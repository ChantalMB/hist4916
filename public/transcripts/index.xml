Part One When I was a kid, I lived in the hinterland of Ottawa.

Part One So this week is an important week in the class. This is the week where you get to choose your own DHMuse adventure. And by choose your own adventure. I mean- you know the first time I did this class I had a huge list of readings that I wanted everybody to get through. It was in fact quite overwhelming. Both for the students and for myself.</description>

Part One Hey everybody, welcome to week three of the course. In this week, we have two major tasks ahead of us. This is the first of two weeks where you can prep your materials for our asynchronous seminar discussions coming up. It&amp;rsquo;s also the first week where you have an opportunity to start polishing or developing your digital skills in particular. We&amp;rsquo;re going to use what are called Jupiter notebooks, these are well, they&amp;rsquo;re interesting.</description>
