        <description>In weeks 5 - 8, we are going to use Hypothesis as a platform to collaboratively explore the materials that you selected last week for your adventure.
In order to do that, you need to prepare your materials. I am giving you two weeks to prepare for this. Consider the amount of work as being similar to what you would do for a very good seminar presentation.
Goals for this week  Read and think about your selected materials carefully Prep them for the rest of us Improve your digital literacy  Listen  Episode 3 Script/Transcript</description>
