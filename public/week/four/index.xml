        <description>In weeks 5 - 8, we are going to use Hypothesis as a platform to collaboratively explore the materials that you selected in week 3 for your adventure.
In order to do that, you need to prepare your materials. I am giving you two weeks to prepare for this. Consider the amount of work as being similar to what you would do for a very good seminar presentation.
Goals for this week  Read and think about your selected materials carefully Prep them for the rest of us Continue to improve your digital literacy  Listen Episode 4 of course podcast goes here</description>
