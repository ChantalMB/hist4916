The possible readings are grouped under four broad headings. They represent merely a starting point, not a canon.
Foundations: Cultural Heritage &amp;amp; Information  in which we lay the groundwork for our understanding of CHI, its larger contexts, and what the major research questions are.

        <description>Basic Skills We are going to use Jupyter Notebooks in this class. For a global overview of how Jupyter notebooks work and are used in humanities research, see Quinn Dombrowski&amp;rsquo;s lesson in The Programming Historian. The links below go to either live notebooks that you can work through, or guide you through some of the same steps that Dombrowski discusses, but with more detail.

        <title>Guidance for Discussion Leaders</title>

        <description>The role of the Discussion Leader is to set us up for a deeper engagement with the task. You are the trailblazer, the guide, the scout, the point of first-contact, with a new and puzzling text. If there are two discussion leaders for a week, divy up the work between you equitably.
The seminar discussions all happen through the medium of Hypothes.is annotations: it is critical that you get these prepared in advance of your official &amp;lsquo;week&amp;rsquo; so that Collaborative Readers can respond.</description>

        <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re not a Discussion Leader in a given week, you&amp;rsquo;re a Collaborative Reader, and your task is to enrichen our understanding of the material by engaging with the texts in a generous way. Following Kathleen Fitzpatrick, I understand &amp;lsquo;generous thinking&amp;rsquo; to work like this:
 Generous Thinking [begins] by proposing that rooting the humanities in generosity, and in particular in the practices of thinking with rather than reflexively against [emphasis added] both the people and the materials with which we work, might invite more productive relationships and conversations not just among scholars but between scholars and the surrounding community.</description>

        <description>If any of the instructions below are unclear, annotate this page with hypothesis while being logged into our course reading group. If you spot someone asking for help and you can offer advice, respond to the annotation.
Read completely through before trying to set things up.
 Introduction Github is a code sharing website often used by digital historians. &amp;lsquo;Git&amp;rsquo; is a program that takes snapshots of the current state of a folder, and stores them in sequence, allowing you to revert your changes to an earlier state.</description>

        <description>Your Case Study Is Due Before the End of Week 12 You will have submitted the link to your Jupyter Notebook at the end of week 9. If all goes according to plan, I will have bundled these altogether into a supporting website, the Ottawa GLAM Workbench (fyi, repo here) and used the My Binder service to make these live online, by the end of week 10. This gives you 2 weeks to create a &amp;lsquo;case study&amp;rsquo; document that can then be integrated into the workbench.</description>

Format The format of the exit ticket is up to you. Text, audio, video, multimedia: go wild.
Content Collect evidence detailing your journey in this course, and use the frame, &amp;lsquo;So what is Cultural Heritage Informatics, anyway?&amp;rsquo; to situate your response. You might want to go back to the course description to see what you now think of that description.
This evidence might be individual annotations (yours or someone else&amp;rsquo;s; remember, each annotation has its own permalink) that changed how you thought or make some argument you wish to engage with; it might be your own digital ephemera that emerges out of your contribution to our larger GLAM notebook infrastructure.</description>
