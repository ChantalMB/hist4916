        <title>Installing Jupyter</title>

        <description>Step 1 You need to make yourself familiar with the command line. There are many such tutorials out there; I encourage you to follow this one from Melanie Walsh&amp;rsquo;s Intro to Cultural Analytics class
Step 2 Anaconda is a package of different programming languages and utilities for &amp;lsquo;scientific computing&amp;rsquo;. Go to the installation page and find the version that is appropriate for your machine. Download and then run the installer.</description>

The possible readings are grouped under four broad headings. They represent merely a starting point, not a canon. This list is non-exhaustive, non-canonical, and is heavily tilted towards museums. Let&amp;rsquo;s fix that balance.
If a pdf is online, and you are able to open it in your browser, you should be able to use Hypothes.is on it. Sometimes you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to. In those cases, get in touch with me right away so we can figure something out.</description>

        <title>The Sequence of Technical Work</title>

        <description>This page gathers in one place the sequence of technical work I want you to do or attempt.
You&amp;rsquo;ll see that some things are mission critical, while others are for you to push yourself.
You are not expected to do all of this work in heroic isolation, or to suffer through these exercises not understanding why something doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. Collaborate. Talk to each other. Ask for help. Share screenshots. Divy up the task.</description>

        <title>Computational Notebooks Resources</title>

        <description>A list of interesting / useful notebooks and other things
Basic Skills We are going to use Jupyter Notebooks in this class. For a global overview of how Jupyter notebooks work and are used in humanities research, see Quinn Dombrowski&amp;rsquo;s lesson in The Programming Historian. The links below go to either live notebooks that you can work through, or guide you through some of the same steps that Dombrowski discusses, but with more detail.</description>

        <title>Guidance for Discussion Leaders</title>
        <link>https://dhmuse.netlify.app/building/dl-guidance/</link>

        <description>The role of the Discussion Leader is to set us up for a deeper engagement with the task. You are the trailblazer, the guide, the scout, the point of first-contact, with a new and puzzling text. If there are two discussion leaders for a week, divy up the work between you equitably.
The seminar discussions all happen through the medium of Hypothes.is annotations: it is critical that you get these prepared in advance of your official &amp;lsquo;week&amp;rsquo; so that Collaborative Readers can respond.</description>

        <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re not a Discussion Leader in a given week, you&amp;rsquo;re a Collaborative Reader, and your task is to enrichen our understanding of the material by engaging with the texts in a generous way. Following Kathleen Fitzpatrick, I understand &amp;lsquo;generous thinking&amp;rsquo; to work like this:
 Generous Thinking [begins] by proposing that rooting the humanities in generosity, and in particular in the practices of thinking with rather than reflexively against [emphasis added] both the people and the materials with which we work, might invite more productive relationships and conversations not just among scholars but between scholars and the surrounding community.</description>

        <title>Guidance on Building your own Notebook</title>
        <link>https://dhmuse.netlify.app/building/nb-guidance/</link>

        <description>Goal The goal of your notebook is to produce a computational document that engages with GLAM data from Ottawa. It would be helpful - but not required - to coordinate with your peers so that we have a wide variety of final notebooks. But even if two people created notebooks working with the same data, you would in all likelihood go about it in different ways, and so a user/reader would still learn from your example.</description>

        <title>Guidance for Github</title>

        <description>If any of the instructions below are unclear, annotate this page with hypothesis while being logged into our course reading group. If you spot someone asking for help and you can offer advice, respond to the annotation.
Read completely through before trying to set things up.
 Introduction Github is a code sharing website often used by digital historians. &amp;lsquo;Git&amp;rsquo; is a program that takes snapshots of the current state of a folder, and stores them in sequence, allowing you to revert your changes to an earlier state.</description>

        <title>Guidance for your Notebook Reflection</title>
        <link>https://dhmuse.netlify.app/building/cs-guidance/</link>

        <description>Goal The goal here is to create a kind of guide to a selected notebook that shows what the notebook can do. It walks the user through the notebook, how to use it, perhaps visualize results or ways to extend it, in order to suggest questions a user might want to pose, and why it might matter. That last point is the most &amp;lsquo;case study&amp;rsquo;-ish bit. By providing guidance on the &amp;lsquo;so what&amp;rsquo; question, you will engage with the literature or issues and provide context for non-dh-minded folk should take this work seriously.</description>

        <title>Publishing Data to the Web with Heroku and Datasette</title>
        <link>https://dhmuse.netlify.app/building/datasette-guidance/</link>

        <description>Prerequisites You need to have the following installed on your machine:
 Python. I recommend using Anaconda to manage all of your python related work. Get Anaconda here and get the 3.7 version. In the instructions below, you will also be installing Homebrew if you are on a Mac. Both PC and Windows people will need to install the command line interface (CLI) for Heroku. I recommend Mac people install Homebrew so that they can download the CLI from their terminal (also, lots of useful software is distributed using Homebrew).</description>
