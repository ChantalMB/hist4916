This is often accomplished through an ongoing Socratic dialogue with a seminar leader or instructor, or through a more formal presentation of research.

I recommend using Anaconda to manage all of your python related work. Get Anaconda here and get the 3.7 version. In the instructions below, you will also be installing Homebrew if you are on a Mac. Both PC and Windows people will need to install the command line interface (CLI) for Heroku. I recommend Mac people install Homebrew so that they can download the CLI from their terminal (also, lots of useful software is distributed using Homebrew). Windows people don\u0026rsquo;t need Homebrew; they can install the CLI installer for Windows from the Heroku page.  What is Heroku? Heroku is a platform for delivering web apps. For our purposes, it\u0026rsquo;s free. The 0.50$ tour - a simple server just delivers basic static webpages to the web. If you want some kind of interactivity, or you\u0026rsquo;re doing complex database driven queries and functions, you need a server with a lot more power. Heroku does that. In my guidance on using Datasette with Glitch you learned that Glitch can host very small datasets using Glitch\u0026rsquo;s collaborative coding environment. This is great for when you want to quickly test something out, or share very small data, but it\u0026rsquo;s not a good solution if you want to put larger materials online. We\u0026rsquo;ll use Heroku for that.\nHere we go! 1. Create a python environment for your work Open a new terminal (Mac) or start up Conda and start a new terminal window (Windows). (Windows users, look for \u0026lsquo;command prompt for powershell anaconda\u0026rsquo; and start that.) I make a version of python - an \u0026lsquo;environment\u0026rsquo; - just for working with this course by using the command $ conda create, like so:\n$ conda create --name dhmuse\nand pressing y for \u0026lsquo;yes, i do want to create a pythion environment called \u0026lsquo;dhmuse\u0026rsquo;'. There are many different packages or bundles of python-legos out there that can be combined to do lots of different things. You create environments to manage all of these pieces so that you don\u0026rsquo;t create conflicts. I create an environment for analytical work, or for creative work, or for database work, or for a unique project, so that my different pieces of code have just the right pieces they need. Then, I can remind myself what conda environments I have by entering:\n$ conda env list\nand can then select the one I want by typing it in after the \u0026lsquo;activate\u0026rsquo; command:\n$ conda activate dhmuse\nWhen I\u0026rsquo;m finished, I can type\n$ conda deactivate\nand I\u0026rsquo;m done. Remember! The convention when writing about code is to provide the command prompt $ or \u0026gt; but you do not enter that prompt yourself!\n2. Install datasette and csvs-to-sqlite At the $ prompt in your new environment which has been activated (you\u0026rsquo;ll see the name of your environment now appearing in your command line), you\u0026rsquo;ll install a utility that converts csvs to sqlite format; that is, from a plain table to a table formatted for use with sql powered databases:\n$ pip install csvs-to-sqlite\nThen\n$ pip install datasette\nbecause we are installing inside the environment we just created these particular commands (packages; boxes of code legos) will not be available after you type conda deactivate. They live inside this environment only.\n More info about CSVS-toSQLITE https://github.com/simonw/csvs-to-sqlite More info about Datasette https://datasette.readthedocs.io  3. Convert your table of data to a database Now we convert your csv table of data to a sql database:\n$ csvs-to-sqlite your-data-table.csv your-database.db\nWhen it finishes running, check it out via datasette:\n$ datasette your-datasette.db\nTa da! Your data is running probably at http://127.0.0.1:8001. Check it out! Hit ctrl+c in your terminal to stop it.\n4. Publish to the web; install Heroku command line tools Now we\u0026rsquo;re going to publish to the web, putting it on space at heroku\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re on a Mac, get homebrew to install heroku by running these command:\n$ /usr/bin/ruby -e \u0026quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\u0026quot;\n$ brew tap heroku/brew \u0026amp;\u0026amp; brew install heroku\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re on Windows, download and run the installer.\n5. Get an account at Heroku Now, go to Heroku.com and make an account. Keep note of your username and your password, you\u0026rsquo;ll need them.\n6. Login to Heroku at the command line Back in the terminal/command line, now that Heroku is installed, tell it you want to login to your account:\n$ heroku login -i\nIt\u0026rsquo;ll ask you for your username and password; enter them.\nDrumroll please!\n7. Publish to the web Now we publish your database file to the web:\n$ datasette publish heroku --name cstm-demo cstm.db\nwhere the --name flag is the subdomain you want your data to be available at. In my case, my choice of \u0026lsquo;cstm-demo\u0026rsquo; becomes available at http://cstm-demo.herokuapp.com\nReference The publish-to-heroku command has many options:\n$ datasette publish heroku --help\nUsage: datasette publish heroku [OPTIONS] [FILES]...

Anyone\u0026hellip;?\n(Photos by Scott Web https://unsplash.com/photos/ab80p262fFM and Ilya Pavlov https://unsplash.com/photos/OqtafYT5kTw )\nHIST4916a Museums and Digital History How do museums and other organizations in the ‘GLAM’ sector (galleries, libraries, archives, museums) keep track of their collections? To what purpose? What might happen if we release these collections into the wild (via the internet)? If we mash these collections together what might we see, and why might it matter? Where are the dangers - and to whom could it be dangerous?\nWhat is Cultural Heritage Informatics? The intersection of digital history and museums might be found within the broader field of ‘cultural heritage informatics’. Cultural heritage materials require careful description and organization to permit effective curation, preservation, management, and research. You may have heard the term ‘bioinformatics’ before; that field defines itself as\n ‘the interdisciplinary field that studies and pursues the effective uses of biomedical data, information, and knowledge for scientific inquiry, problem solving and decision making, motivated by efforts to improve human health.’ (Kulikowski et al 2012)\n …in which case, we could define CHI similarly as an interdisciplinary field studying and pursuing the effective use of cultural heritage data, information, and knowledge for humanistic or scientific inquiry, problem solving, and decision making, motivated by efforts to improve human welfare. I added the emphasis there to make an important point. The decisions we make about information are necessarily ethical decisions. Computers operate by replicating the decisions we make, at enormous speed and scale. The consequences can be unintended and unforeseen, and so we have to begin from an ethical perspective that considers from the outset: who will this harm?\nYou do not need to be \u0026lsquo;techy\u0026rsquo; to be successful in this course! You just need to be diligent, honest, and open. This course is not as tech heavy as some of my other classes. Nevertheless, you will be exposed to several platforms, techs, and approaches that you may not have experienced before. The key is to be open and willing to talk about when things don\u0026rsquo;t go as expected.\nYou will read, watch, listen to, and discuss the class materials via various online tools including Hypothes.is and Github (Speaking of Hypothes.is, highlight a word on this page and see what happens). We do not use cuLearn in the course. We work on the open web instead. What is challenging for one student will not necessarily be challenging for another, and I expect you to push yourself and pull others along as you go. Thus open and honest reporting of what works and what hasn’t worked, is a meaningful aspect of this course. Again: You don’t need to be techy to succeed, but you do need to be willing to embrace when things go ‘wrong’.\nMy goal here is to teach you to use certain digital techs; to unpack and interrogate those techs you learn to use; and to equip you to use these things in a reflective manner. It\u0026rsquo;s about history and musuems and informatics, but also, looking at informatics from a perspective grounded in history. It\u0026rsquo;s going to be uncomfortable. There will be things we try here that will not work. That\u0026rsquo;s why part of the exit ticket for this course will be for you to rethink the one part of the course that was most affecting for you to make it better, but also, to think through who it might harm.\nText/Tech To the best of my ability, all materials will either be open access materials on the web or materials made available to us through MacOdrum Library or the University. You will not be required to purchase any set text or software.\nHaving a reasonably up-to-date computer will make life easier for you; if you use a chromebook or a low-powered laptop (eg, less than 8 gb of RAM), this will require us to think creatively about some of the work, but should not present an insurmountable obstacle. A good internet connection will make life easier, but I realize that not everyone is well-served by our tech oligopolies. Please let me know if these situations apply to you so that we can work out a suitable plan of action.\nClass format This class will be delivered online, asynchronously. A Discord server will be used to provide a social context to our work, for help, and for collaboration. Learning materials will be curated on this open course website, and might include a variety of modalities. There will be no required synchronous chats or lectures. Students will maintain various materials on the web via Github (your Github account may be anonymous or pseudonymous or made private provided access is shared with me).\nWhy? I\u0026rsquo;ve taught online for a variety of institutions, using a variety of formats and approaches. I like teaching asnchronously because I believe it is a kinder approach to complex topics, especially when there is a second layer of difficulty - basic digital literacy, in this case - which intersects with the content, my learning goals for you, your own personal situations - in ways I cannot always anticipate or know.\nSince I cannot know these things, I do not believe that I should bludgeon you with content; I do not think that \u0026lsquo;rigour\u0026rsquo; is demonstrated by forcing you to join me at set times; I do not believe that face-to-face work is somehow more \u0026lsquo;scholarly\u0026rsquo; than other kinds of work. Right now, with the world the way it is, I want to build a structure that opens possibility space for you to engage with this topic, and with \u0026lsquo;digital archaeology\u0026rsquo; when you encounter it beyond this course, in ways that will push you forward as a scholar and citizen.\nFor this to work well, it requires you to be on the same page as me. There is a lot of flexibility built into this course, but it does require you to try to push yourself out of your comfort zone. The key thing is always to tie what you\u0026rsquo;re doing with what you\u0026rsquo;re reading and what you\u0026rsquo;re thinking. That \u0026lsquo;second layer of difficulty\u0026rsquo; will come with practice. But how it intersects with everything else: that\u0026rsquo;s where the learning happens.\n\u0026hellip;and that is why this course is the way it is. No doubt, things will break, and some things will work better/be more effective than others. We will roll with it.\n","description":"what to tell your friends","id":13,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"1. Course Description","uri":"https://dhmuse.netlify.app/docs/1-coursedescription/"},{"content":"Questions How do institutions in the GLAM sector use digital media to support their missions?\nDo digital techs push us towards particular voices in GLAM materials?\nCan/do digital techs in the service of GLAM harm different communities? And if so, how? And what can we do about it?\nWhere are the new frontiers in CHI and GLAM?\nThis course is an opportunity to explore these questions; I do not know the answers! I\u0026rsquo;m excited to figure these out with you. Why not annotate this section with some of your own questions?\nNb The process of teaching is also a process of collaboration between me and you. Sometimes -and we\u0026rsquo;re expecting this, you and I- things won\u0026rsquo;t work as we expect; tech might break; the world might impinge too much. We will adapt accordingly. Remember: the grade in this course is a function of your process and your evolution, so adapting and thinking through the implications of when things don\u0026rsquo;t go according to plan is, in fact, according to plan. Outcomes  Situate the practice, ethical, and intellectual trajectories of informatics within the cultural heritage field Implement and contribute to a ‘GLAM Workbench’, a series of interactive computational notebooks dealing with data from the Ottawa galleries-libraries-archives-museums sector Investigate open data sources, using the methods/techniques/perspectives of digital history and digital humanities Develop how-to for the workbench that communicate the results of these investigations as an act of public digital history Given that this is an online course, another outcome will be your ability to conduct such research independently. However, no one operates in a vacuum; digital historians collaborate to troubleshoot or develop technologies, and through open practices to data sharing and reuse, learn to build upon each others’ work in a collaborative fashion.  Real Names Policy You do not need to use your real name or identity on any public-facing work that you do in this course. Nor do you need to explain to me that you wish to use a pseudonym. It is sufficient that you send an email to me with the following message:\n‘I would like to use the following username in all public-facing work: xxxxxxxx’\n…where xxxxx is the name you have selected. For safety’s sake, if you decide to use a pseudonym, do not use one that you have used on any other website or social media platform.\nWhen Life Intervenes There\u0026rsquo;s nothing we can\u0026rsquo;t roll with, in this class. That said, I can\u0026rsquo;t help you if I don\u0026rsquo;t know you need help, a breathing space, some direction. When something comes up, just let me know:\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to share the details with me. It is enough for me to know that something has intervened. I trust you.\r When something comes up and this course has to move to the backburner, contact me and we can figure out something else to do, or something else that will help you be successful here. It\u0026rsquo;s our course - we can change things up as we need to.\n","description":"what you'll get out of this course","id":14,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"2. Learning Outcomes","uri":"https://dhmuse.netlify.app/docs/2-learning-outcomes/"},{"content":"Tangible Output of this Class Each of you will produce a computational notebook - a kind of website that has code within it that can be run, together with text and images describing what\u0026rsquo;s going on - that is focussed on the Ottawa GLAM scene.\nAll of these notebooks will be gathered together by me into an \u0026lsquo;Ottawa GLAM Workbench\u0026rsquo; (taking our cue from the inspiring work of Tim Sherratt and his GLAM Workbench on Australian and New Zealand\u0026rsquo;s cultural heritage).\nYou will produce a case study using one of our notebooks (yours or one of your peer\u0026rsquo;s); collaboration is encouraged. These case studies will be integrated into the workbench after the class is finished.\nHeritageJam Last year, when I ran this course, the idea was to use the course as a platform to launch the HeritageJam jam event, with online and in-person components. The pandemic of course kiboshed that. This year, I still want to run HeritageJam, and I\u0026rsquo;d like to have our Ottawa GlAM Workbench play a central role as a resource for a fully-online event. I have funds to support this, and I hope to be able to hire one or two of you to help develop the Ottawa GLAM Workbench further, and to help put the event on.\n","description":"what we are working towards","id":15,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"3.

You will do a deep annotation on the materials.\nThe second third will be our asynchronous rotating discussion, conducted in the threads of the various annotations each of us will have prepped on our materials. In a given week, the focus will shift from one batch of materials to another as we discuss collaboratively.\nThe final third will when we build our GLAM workbench; the \u0026lsquo;notebook\u0026rsquo; pages will be accompanied by documentation explaining how to use them, what a user might find, and tie this discussion into the literature we explored..\n","description":"what happens when, and where","id":16,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"4. Course Schedule","uri":"https://dhmuse.netlify.app/docs/4-schedule/"},{"content":"There is no midterm. There is no final exam.\r You grade emerges from the following elements.\n  Discussion Leaders. Each student will be responsible to \u0026lsquo;page prep\u0026rsquo; cetain readings. Page prep involves:\n Creating the Reading Overview: a brief overview page note attached to the assigned reading using Hypothes.is page notes Creating the Reading Pre-seed: at least five rich annotations on the assigned readings In the relevant week, when the other students read the papers, the student responsible for \u0026lsquo;page prep\u0026rsquo; will engage and respond to the annotations of their peers in such a fashion as to dig deeper into the topic at hand    Collaborative Readers. Each student is responsible each week to respond in a timely fashion (eg, first half of the week) to overview annotations and seeded annotations such that the page preparer can respond in turn. This isn\u0026rsquo;t a hard and fast weekly deadline; it\u0026rsquo;s rather a courtesy from you to your peers.\n  Each student will craft at least one Jupyter notebook that engages with a source of GLAM data in Ottawa. See the \u0026lsquo;Technical Notes\u0026rsquo; for more info on the mechanics. The notebook should do something meaningful with the data (at least two examples of \u0026lsquo;something meaningful\u0026rsquo; within a single notebook). It could be a visualization of a certain subset of information. It could show how to map the material. It might make the material more easily available. Other things are possible.\n the notebook will combine both the code and the documentation explaining what is going on, where the data is coming from, how to run the notebook. the jupyter notebook will be kept under version control in Github.    Notebook Reflection. Each student will write a document to accompany the notebook that situates what the notebook does in the broader literature and discussion that we have already examined. It might walk the user through the notebook to suggest further questions a user might want to pose, and why it might matter, or ways the work could be extended.. This will be written as a text file using Markdown conventions, that cites readings and other pertinent materials; it might also link to relevant annotations in our discussions.\n  You also have the option to write an exit ticket reflecting on the entire process (see below). Again, this is optional.\n  The Exit Ticket Optional You may wish to produce an \u0026lsquo;exit ticket\u0026rsquo; for me at the end of the course (open format) reflecting on where you started and where you\u0026rsquo;ve gotten to. This document will indicate how you feel you\u0026rsquo;ve done against the learning outcomes; this is an opportunity for you to tell me what grade reflects your work best (see below for how meeting the outcomes translates to a grade). Please explicitly tie your exit ticket to the evidence of your journey (annotations, digital ephemera, etc). Everyone\u0026rsquo;s journey is different. Digital methods are more a matter of practice and time than they are of aptitude.\nYour \u0026lsquo;exit ticket\u0026rsquo; will explain to me your particular context, and it will point to the evidence that demonstrates how you\u0026rsquo;ve moved along from where you were at the beginning to where you are now.\nIf I agree with your assessment, then that is the grade you will receive (thus, you have the opportunity to override the percentage breakdowns below).\nWhen I have disagreed in previous courses this has been, 9.5 times out of 10, to raise the grade: y\u0026rsquo;all are too hard on yourselves. If I have disagreed and felt that you\u0026rsquo;ve overstated things - if you were the 0.5 out of 10 - we would talk and come to an agreement.\nThe Exit Ticket, if you choose to do it, should be submitted within one week of the last day of the winter term.\nFurther guidance on the Exit Ticket is available under the Technical Notes.\nGrading make sure these agree with the learning outcomes\nRemembering the learning outcomes,\n   Learning Outcome A B C D eg. Jo Q Student     1. analytical ability - - - - X   2. methodology - - - - -   3. collaboration - - - - X   4. argumentation - - - - X   5. professionalization - - - - -    \u0026hellip;5/5 would be an A, 4/5 would be a B, 3/5 would be a C, 2/5 a D.\nIn this example, based on my consideration of Jo Q Student\u0026rsquo;s evidence and the feedback I\u0026rsquo;d written him over the six weeks, it seemed to me that he did what she needed to do (satisfactorily) for 3 out of the 5 outcomes and so earned a C. However, her exit ticket might bring her up. Percentage Breakdown I am required by the University to provide a percentage breakdown.\n Discussion leading: 20% (graded: satisfactory / meh /unsatisfactory) Collaborative reading: 20% (graded: satisfactory / meh / unsatisfactory ) Jupyter Notebook: 20% Notebook Reflection: 40% Exit Ticket: optional  Important dates:\n Discussion leader prep to be completed by the end of week 4 Collaborative reading - completed each week weeks 5 - 8 Jupyter Notebook - aim to complete by week 11; submit by week 12 Notebook Reflection - due 10 days after the end of term.  I reserve the right to adjust those percentages to take into account the particular circumstances of the student. Note that depending on your argument in the Exit Ticket, I can be persuaded the adjust those percentages to put more weight on one thing rather than another, etc.\n","description":"grading and ungrading","id":17,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"5.

Collaborate. Talk to each other. Ask for help. Share screenshots. Divy up the task.\nExplaining that you had trouble with something, and identifying the source of the trouble, and/or reaching out for help is a sign of strength, not weakness.\nThe indications of time are not prescriptive in the sense that if it takes you longer than this you are somehow not a clever person. Rather, it\u0026rsquo;s an indication of how long I estimate a task might take if everything goes more or less according to plan. But if after 30 minutes you\u0026rsquo;re flummoxed, STOP. Ask for help. Share what\u0026rsquo;s going on, with me or with a peer. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DO THIS ALONE.\r There\u0026rsquo;s more to a task than just running code; I do want you to think and talk about what the process implies in the context of our readings, or other things you\u0026rsquo;ve done. You might encounter problems that slow you down, meaning you might take longer than my estimated time, and that\u0026rsquo;s ok. I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing this for a while; my estimates might be out of whack. Key thing: I don\u0026rsquo;t want to hear that you laboured at something for ages before you reached out for help.\nAgain, you have my explicit permission to quit these tasks when things stop making sense and to ask for help from your peers, friends, family, random strangers, me, anyone. Just record what happened, the kinds of errors, screenshots, or anything else that will help me troubleshoot with you.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t about catching you out: it\u0026rsquo;s about learning how to do this stuff. And having things break or not work is part of that process. I expect there to be hiccups and frustrations: that\u0026rsquo;s part of the plan.\n Getting Started This might be the first time you\u0026rsquo;ve done anything more complicated with your machine than write an essay. Just take your time, and keep note of what\u0026rsquo;s going on.\nI\u0026rsquo;d like everyone to make sure they get through, and understand:\n Week 1: Hypothesis; Github; Discord. 1 hr  In Week 2, I want you to at least explore. If you can go further, do so!\n Week 2: Explore the GLAM Workbench. 1 hr  Go further: see if you can figure out how to run some of the notebooks in the GLAM workbench\nGoing even further: make some changes to those notebooks, and save the changes. 2 hrs\nBasic Skills I\u0026rsquo;d like everyone to make sure they get through, and understand, these two tasks:\n Week 3: The Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks. 30 - 40 minutes Week 3: The Introduction to Python Notebook. 1 hr  If you\u0026rsquo;re feeling good about things: Push yourself, and follow the install and run Jupyter on your own machine instructions; download one of the notebooks and see if you can run it locally. 1 hr. Not a requirement.\nPlease complete, and understand:\n  Week 4: Explore the two notebooks from the National Library of Scotland; copy to your own Github; see if you can launch from your own repo using the Binder service. 45 min. If you\u0026rsquo;re feeling good about this: Push yourself, and modify (and save) the code to visualize some other aspect of the data: 45 min.\n  Week 4: Build a dataset of materials from the Museum of History using the simple scraper notebook. 1.5 hrs.\n  We take a break from the tech aspect during weeks 5 to 8. However, if you find yourself with time and you are so inclined, I would encourage you to practice what you\u0026rsquo;ve already learned, and see if you can push the examples you\u0026rsquo;ve encountered further. 30 - 45 minutes per week say? You might wish to make a start on the next technical stuff now, if you know that your other courses will be heavy towards the end of term.\r Build On What You\u0026rsquo;ve Learned  Week 9: Complete the notebook on visualizing data. 30 mins. Week 9: Write a notebook from scratch that grabs open data from CSTM and then visualize one dimension (column) from the data. 2 hrs.  If you\u0026rsquo;re feeling good about things: Push yourself, and add more visualizations from the demo data for this week, or from the CSTM, or from the National Library of Scotland, or from the Museum of History. 2 hrs. Not a requirement.\n Week 10: Cleaning Data with R. 2 hrs  If you\u0026rsquo;re feeling good about things: Push yourself, and try pushing some of your data online with the Datasette package. 2 hrs. Not a requirement\n Week 11: Make a new notebook that ingests data from a Datasette created by one of your peers, or from the example supplied by Dr. Graham. It should also visualize or otherwise work with the data. 2 hrs  If you\u0026rsquo;re feeling good about things: Push yourself, and see if you can visualize the provenance of your data (create a notebook that maps the origins of your data). 2 hrs. Not a requirement. Push yourself further: build a notebook that creatively warps/deforms the data (eg, sonification). 3 hrs. Not a requirement.\nBuild Your Contribution to the Ottawa GLAM Workbench  Week 12: Build your official notebook for submission (code + commentary). Write the documentation that contextualizes the notebook. Devote all of the time you have this week to this task. 5 hrs  My estimate of the total time on tech tasks (not counting the \u0026lsquo;push yourself\u0026rsquo; materials) over the 12 weeks: 17.25 hrs.\n","description":"Technical tasks listed by week with an estimate of how much time they will take","id":20,"section":"building","tags":null,"title":"The Sequence of Technical Work","uri":"https://dhmuse.netlify.app/building/tech-req-at-a-gland/"},{"content":"The role of the Discussion Leader is to set us up for a deeper engagement with the task. You are the trailblazer, the guide, the scout, the point of first-contact, with a new and puzzling text. If there are two discussion leaders for a week, divy up the work between you equitably.\nThe seminar discussions all happen through the medium of Hypothes.is annotations: it is critical that you get these prepared in advance of your official \u0026lsquo;week\u0026rsquo; so that Collaborative Readers can respond. Photo by Harli Marten, unsplash.com\nWhile the tips below assume you are writing your annoations, an annotation can also display video or audio. Optionally, you are welcome to use video or audio as well, if you\u0026rsquo;d like; this might work best for the page-level annotations (see below).\nYou can post video to youtube and mark it \u0026lsquo;unlisted\u0026rsquo;; then paste the URL to the video in the annotation. Hypothesis will automatically display the video in the annotation.\nFor audio, you might use something like soundcloud. Other options are available.\nTips for annotating passages in the text   Look for what is puzzling, intriguing, or ambiguous in the text. If you read a passage, and you find yourself pausing because you\u0026rsquo;re not sure what you just read, that\u0026rsquo;s a good sign that here is something that needs unpacking.\n  Try not to annotate whole paragraphs. Keep the focus tight - a sentence or two; sometimes even just a phrase or a single word.\n  Use the toolbar within the Hypothesis annotation interface to emphasize your points. Use italics, bullet points, or bold text to highlight or emphasize as appropriate. Insert links to other relevant texts or annotations (every annotation has its own unique URL or \u0026lsquo;permalink\u0026rsquo;) if that will help to make your point. You can also insert images or youtube videos!\n  Add tags to your annotation to categorize the nature of the annotation or the idea under discussion. As we go through the course, we will see connections emerge between the readings as a result of these tags; when you write your case study, notebook, or exit ticket, being able to see all of the annotations using a particular tag (and then link to them) will deepen all our understanding of the materials.\n  Try to ask open ended questions, or make observations that invite more than \u0026lsquo;yes\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;no\u0026rsquo; responses.\n  Aim for at least 5 good annotations per paper.\n  Use Crowdlaaers or Jon Udell\u0026rsquo;s Facet Viewer to keep track of annotations, so that you can respond in a timely fashion to other\u0026rsquo;s annotations. Crowlaaers.org;Facet Viewer. For both of these, you need to add your API token. (You can find that here, when you\u0026rsquo;re already logged into Hypothesis). Once you copy your token, paste it in Crowdlaaers by clicking on the \u0026lsquo;Groups\u0026rsquo; button; on the facet viewer, scroll to the bottom and paste it in the \u0026lsquo;Hypothesis API token\u0026rsquo; box; then hit refresh on your browser.\n  Tips for annotating the whole document (\u0026lsquo;page\u0026rsquo; annotations) Your whole-page annotation gives a global overview of why this document is important, and what it offers to the rest of us.\n  You can make the annotation in text, or you can record yourself speaking about the document. If you choose the latter, you could make an \u0026lsquo;unlisted\u0026rsquo; youtube video, and then paste the youtube URL into the annotation box. Hypothesis will embed the video directly. You could just record audio if you want; soundcloud.com can host those, and you could then just embed the link.\n  use the THOMAS mnemonic to help you create a succinct overview (by Danna Agmon)\n  THOMAS stands for \u0026lsquo;Topic Historiography Organization Method Argument So what\u0026rsquo;\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to address every aspect of the mnemonic in the same depth, and I\u0026rsquo;m not looking for essays here.

Danna Agmon organized this mnemonic so that the questions are arranged in ascending order of importance, from least to most. So if you have to hedge your bets, the \u0026lsquo;so what\u0026rsquo; is the most critical thing I want to see in your full-page annotation.\n Topic: The basic questions: When? Where?

What does it add to these conversations?\nOrganization: what is the central organizing structure of this work? Chronological? Thematic? Geographic? Are there any narrative devices put to use?

It also allows you to create branches, or duplicates of your folder, so you can experiment. If you like the results of your work, you can merge that branch back into your original.\nGithub therefore is a hub for sharing these git snapshots.\nA branch (a copy, a duplicate) of your work uploaded to Github could therefore be copied to say my account (a fork); then I might download to my machine to work on it (I\u0026rsquo;ve pulled it). Once I\u0026rsquo;m happy with my changes, I commit them (save them to the sequence of changes that Git tracks), and then I could push those changes to the fork in my account. I would then send you a pull request or notification, asking you to pull my changes back to your account; you could then decide whether or not to merge.\nFor our purposes, you will use Github mostly as a place to put your reflections or other pieces of work; when we combine Github repos with other things, like Binder, we have the foundation for our own digital infrastructure. I might sometimes fork your work, pull it down onto my machine, make changes that I commit, push it back online, and ask you to pull the changes back. But that won\u0026rsquo;t happen very often. It takes a while to get comfortable with this. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of useful code, in the cultural heritage informatics space, that gets shared on Github. Knowing the basics enables you to enter this world.\nGet your account  Got to github.com and sign up for an account. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to use your real name. (Protip: You might want to set up an email just for signing up for things.)  Verify your account.  Select the free tier (nb: I will never require you to pay for any reading, or any software. If something wants you to pay, stop and ask for help).  Skip telling Github anything about yourself.  Do the verification email thing. Once you hit the verification link in your email, you\u0026rsquo;ll be brought back to Github to make a new repository:  Give it a reasonable name; below I just called it week-one. Tick the \u0026lsquo;initialize with a readme\u0026rsquo; box, tick off the \u0026lsquo;private\u0026rsquo; box, and hit the green commit button. (Nb It\u0026rsquo;s your choice to choose public OR private):  And on the final page, hit the \u0026lsquo;dismiss\u0026rsquo; button in the \u0026lsquo;Github Actions box\u0026rsquo;  Ta Da! You now have a github account, and you\u0026rsquo;ve created your first repository. Going Forward you can create a new repository for any week\u0026rsquo;s work, for a distinct project, and so on. You can create a new repository from the plus sign in the top right corner:\nnb Remember to tick off the \u0026lsquo;initialize with a readme.md\u0026rsquo; file.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve done that, you\u0026rsquo;ll be at your Github user page:\nAdd me as a collaborator to this and any subsequent private repositories you create for this course:   Private Repo: Then, once you\u0026rsquo;ve clicked on \u0026lsquo;manage access\u0026rsquo;, click on \u0026lsquo;invite collaborator\u0026rsquo;,\n  Private Repo: Then find my username shawngraham, and add me:\n  Setting up a \u0026lsquo;repository\u0026rsquo; for your work A \u0026lsquo;repository\u0026rsquo; is just a folder that you\u0026rsquo;ve shared on Github. There are two ways to do this; the easy way and the more complex way. Luck you, you have already done the easy way - you selected the initialize with a readme, and it\u0026rsquo;s already present in your browser!\nTo create new repositories, just click on the + button on the top right of your Github page when you\u0026rsquo;re logged in. Remember to tick off the initialize with a readme box. Think about whether you want them private or public. But if you didn\u0026rsquo;t tick the initialize box, you\u0026rsquo;ve embarked on the more complex way. In the screenshot below, I created a new repository but I forgot to initialize it, and now I\u0026rsquo;m looking at this page:\nIf this is you, do not despair.\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;ve forgotten to initialize a new repo: You\u0026rsquo;re going to have to install one or two things, and do some work at the command prompt or terminal.\n If you have a PC, click on this link to download and install git. Just use all of the suggested default settings when you run the installer. If you have a Mac, you can install it by opening the terminal program (click on your applications and type \u0026lsquo;terminal\u0026rsquo; in the search window) and then typing in these two commands (or copy and paste). The first command starts at the / and ends at the \u0026quot; and you must include the entire line from slash to closing quotation mark:  /bin/bash -c \u0026quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)\u0026quot; and when that finishes,\nbrew install git Make a new directory on your computer with the same name as the repo you created above. For my screenshotted example above, that would be week-two. On a PC, find the folder in your file explorer; click on it so that\u0026rsquo;s the folder displayed in the address bar at the top of the explorer. Then, click in the address bar and type cmd and hit enter. This will open a command prompt window for that folder, allowing you to type commands in directly. On a Mac, go to System Preferences, select Keyboard \u0026gt; Shortcuts \u0026gt; Services. Look for \u0026lsquo;New Terminal at Folder\u0026rsquo; and tick the box. Open your finder; find the folder you created, right-click and select \u0026lsquo;open Terminal here\u0026rsquo;.  A Quick Primer for Working at the Command Line or Terminal\nThe following two videos, one for PC, one for Mac, show you how to do this. For reference\u0026rsquo;s sake, this is what \u0026lsquo;working at the command prompt\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;working at the terminal\u0026rsquo; look like on your machine. When you interact with your computer, you can do it through a graphical interface - icons, clicks, etc - or you can directly type in commands. It\u0026rsquo;s this latter kind of interaction that most people think of as \u0026lsquo;coding\u0026rsquo;, but for us, this is just \u0026lsquo;opening the hood\u0026rsquo;.\n PC:\n  Mac:\n  Key commands for PC:\n dir show the contents of the current directory cls clear the window so that it\u0026rsquo;s fresh again cd directory-name change director to the named directory cd .. change directory up one level if you hit the up or down arrows you can cycle through the history of commands you\u0026rsquo;ve already typed  Key commands for Mac:\n ls list the contents of the current directory pwd print the path (location) of the current directory cd directory-name change director to the named directory cd .. change directory up one level history prints out the entire history of commands you\u0026rsquo;ve typed this session up and down arrows will cycle through this list  Do you see where, in your browser at github, it says ...or create a new repository on the command line? With your command prompt or terminal open in the appropriate folder on your machine (remember, folders on your machine = repos on github), type in each line exactly as it is there (beginning with echo), hitting enter at the end of each line, in order. If the command works, you\u0026rsquo;ll just be presented with the next prompt. The computer only ever responds when there is output to print - which often means only when there is an error message to report. (nb Git might prompt you to enter your email and name, as it does in the PC video, the first time you ever do this).  Ta da! You can now go to github.com\\\u0026lt;your-user-name\u0026gt;\\your-repo and you\u0026rsquo;ll see it all there tickety boo.\nMaking a new text file on Github You can make a new text file by clicking on the \u0026lsquo;create new file\u0026rsquo; button; remember to always use .md as the file extension. You can specify headers, links, images, bullets, blockquotes and so on by using markdown conventions\nThe two videos below might be a bit clearer on youtube itself.\n  Uploading a file into Github You can add new files from your computer by dragging and dropping them into the main repository. At the end of this video, I show you how to display the image in the text of the reflection.\n  ","description":"Github nuts and bolts","id":25,"section":"building","tags":null,"title":"Guidance for Github","uri":"https://dhmuse.netlify.app/building/github-guidance/"},{"content":"Your Case Study Is Due at the End of Week 12 \u0026hellip;but I will accept it up to a week after the final day of the Winter term (which this year is April 14; thus, April 21st.)\nI will bundle everyone\u0026rsquo;s notebooks and documentation together into a supporting website, the Ottawa GLAM Workbench (fyi, repo here) and used the My Binder service to make these live online.\nGoal The goal here is to create a kind of guide to a selected notebook that shows what the notebook can do. It walks the user through the notebook, how to use it, perhaps visualize results or ways to extend it, in order to suggest questions a user might want to pose, and why it might matter. That last point is the most \u0026lsquo;case study\u0026rsquo;-ish bit. By providing guidance on the \u0026lsquo;so what\u0026rsquo; question, you will engage with the literature or issues and provide context for non-dh-minded folk should take this work seriously.\nParameters  A single markdown page with footnotes.* You should have a proper text editor like Sublime Text or Atom installed; compose your document using the text editor.  Footnotes can be formatted in markdown like so:\nFootnotes[^1] are added in-text like so ...\nand then at the end of the document, like this:\n[^1]: Graham, S. 2006. _Ex Figlinis_. BAR International Series: Oxford. *It is possible to make an online slideshow out of a markdown document. You might wish to format your document that way. If you do, use this template on the HackMD platform. You can log in with your Github username. Copy it into your text editor; make your edits in your text editor and save locally. When you\u0026rsquo;re ready to test, paste it all into a new note on HackMd, then \u0026lsquo;view in slideshow mode\u0026rsquo; under the sharing button. You can then submit the URL to the slideshow mode version.\nThe two slide shows on the Glam Workbench main page are generated this way.\n Use clear headings and header levels to signal a clear, logical, flow.  Be succinct.  Illustrate. Create screenshots \u0026amp; illustrate these with arrows, circles, etc to make it clear what\u0026rsquo;s going on. On a Mac, you can use cmd+4 to take a screenshot, and then the preview app to annotate it. On a PC, the snip-it tool can be used the same way. Change the names of the files to your-surname-fig-1.png (or .jpg, as appropriate) and so on, so that I don\u0026rsquo;t lose track of things. Insert images into your document with markdown: ![alt-descriptive-text](your-surname-fig-1.png).  Video walkthroughs can be helpful too. I use the free version of https://screencast-o-matic.com/ . The resulting file can be saved on your computer and then placed in your repository; it can also be uploaded to your userspace on screencast-o-matic and then can be embedded from there. If you load it to your own repo, just use ~insert video 1 here~ and I\u0026rsquo;ll do the rest when I compile everything. Otherwise, use the embed code from screencast-o-matic. Mac users can also make quick videos using cmd+5; Windows 10 users can use the x-box app screenrecorder (press Windows+G) (more info).  Provide a link to launch the binder in a live environment.  Full and accurate citations in a \u0026lsquo;References\u0026rsquo; list at the end. Chicago style is fine.  Remember to address the goals for this exercise.

Rather, I am trying to help you learn the skills that you will need to uncover whatever aspect of method and thought that will help you with your research goals. A big part of that is trying to teach how to deal with what might feel like \u0026lsquo;failure\u0026rsquo;, on first blush. I want you to swing for the bleachers, and not to be afraid of whiffing on the ball. After all, to mix sporting metaphors, you\u0026rsquo;re here for icetime not the Stanley Cup.\nOn another note, this course originally was intended to be a kind of hybrid course, blending face to face work in the classroom with resources and digital tools.\nThat of course, can\u0026rsquo;t happen at the moment.\nMoving online just means that I have to work harder at fostering the social aspect of learning and education.\nSocial Contact Another problem with moving fully online is isolation. Working with digital tools and environments, especially when you\u0026rsquo;re not overly familiar with how they work - or even the underlying metaphors that would help you make sense of what\u0026rsquo;s going on - is frustrating. Bad enough when you have classmates you see twice a week and can at least complain with over coffee later; extremely awful when you\u0026rsquo;re on a bad internet connection and everyone thinks that you\u0026rsquo;re not really doing schoolwork.\nIn past classes, I have used Slack as a way of trying to meet that need for human connection that makes learning meaningful. It worked, more or less, but if there was a conversation going on and you missed part of it, it could just feel overwhelming and impenetrable.\nAnd it was one more damned thing to install. One more damned thing to get a password for.\nI tried Zulipchat another year.

You are not alone.\r This website is built using Hugo, a static site builder. Static sites are quicker, more secure, and separate content from container, thus making them more sustainable. I write all of the content in individual text files, which I can then turn into whatever output - html, pdf, word doc - that I need. My writing is freed from subscription-based software that might lock it in. I push all of the text files onto github. Then, I have netlify.com watch those files for any changes. When it spots changes, it uses Hugo to turn them into html, and serves them up to the world.\nI am grateful to Chantal Brousseau, who was instrumental in the design and implementation of this course, through the Students as Partners program at Carleton University.\nThe course logo is by user \u0026lsquo;corpus delicti\u0026rsquo;, at The Noun Project.\n","description":"how the course tech is built; how the course came to be","id":29,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"8.
