Sometimes, the person to whom you\u0026rsquo;re replying might be a previous year\u0026rsquo;s student, but that\u0026rsquo;s ok; they might enter into conversation with you. Sometimes, it might be a person who isn\u0026rsquo;t a Carleton student but is following along with the course. That\u0026rsquo;s ok too. Be respectful!\nThere is a student guide to Hypothes.is behind this link. Read that for the full information how using Hypothesis.\nHypothesis is the main tool we use to enable an asynchronous seminar discussion. Hypothesis exists on the open web, so make sure you\u0026rsquo;re always making your annotations in the group space, not the public space.

We will use it in this class mostly as a social space and a space to get help, especially in the more technical aspects of what we\u0026rsquo;re doing.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t want heroic lone scholars. If you are struggling with something - whether it\u0026rsquo;s the ideas in the readings or the tech - look for help; DM me privately, or post in the relevant week\u0026rsquo;s channel. If you can help someone, jump in. I encourage collaboration. If you get help from someone, just acknowledge it in your own work. Also: in tech work, if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t come in 30 minutes, it won\u0026rsquo;t come in 3 hours Asking for help is not a weakness: it\u0026rsquo;s a sign of strength \u0026amp; scholarly maturity.\r You can download Discord here or you can use it in a broswer.\nYou will receive an invitation email in your Carleton account. It expires after one day, so do join once you get it. It will ask to verify your email; check your spam folder.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;re in, there\u0026rsquo;s a welcome message with a reaction emoji at the end - click on the thumbs up to confirm that you\u0026rsquo;ve read the message. This will unlock the various channels in the server, including voice and screensharing.\nAnd yes, I recycled screenshots from my Crafting Digital History course, but the Digital Archaeology version is more or less the same and hey, I built this course website by hand.\n(Alex is a student who works for me on the bone trade project if you were wondering.)\nYou can customize your profile by clicking on the cogwheel icon at the bottom of the navigation:\nand you can customize how you\u0026rsquo;d like to use voice and video:\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a channel for each week\u0026rsquo;s materials, a channel for general museum or Carleton chat, and a social channel just for shooting the breeze. If you want to chat or stream your machine (eg to show us what you\u0026rsquo;re trying to do and how it\u0026rsquo;s not working) just click on one of the side-chats - make sure you\u0026rsquo;re unmuted!

If you spot someone asking for help and you can offer advice, respond to the annotation. Introduction Github is a code sharing website often used by digital historians. \u0026lsquo;Git\u0026rsquo; is a program that takes snapshots of the current state of a folder, and stores them in sequence, allowing you to revert your changes to an earlier state. It also allows you to create branches, or duplicates of your folder, so you can experiment. If you like the results of your work, you can merge that branch back into your original.\nGithub therefore is a hub for sharing these git snapshots.\nA branch (a copy, a duplicate) of your work uploaded to Github could therefore be copied to say my account (a fork); then I might download to my machine to work on it (I\u0026rsquo;ve pulled it). Once I\u0026rsquo;m happy with my changes, I commit them (save them to the sequence of changes that Git tracks), and then I could push those changes to the fork in my account. I would then send you a pull request or notification, asking you to pull my changes back to your account; you could then decide whether or not to merge.\nFor our purposes, you will use Github mostly as a place to put your reflections or other pieces of work. I might sometimes fork your work, pull it down onto my machine, make changes that I commit, push it back online, and ask you to pull the changes back. But that won\u0026rsquo;t happen very often. It takes a while to get comfortable with this. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of useful code, in the cultural heritage informatics space, that gets shared on Github. Knowing the basics enables you to enter this world.\nGet your account  Got to github.com and sign up for an account. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to use your real name. (Protip: You might want to set up an email just for signing up for things.)  Verify your account.  Select the free tier (nb: I will never require you to pay for any reading, or any software. If something wants you to pay, stop and ask for help).  Skip telling Github anything about yourself.  Do the verification email thing. Once you hit the verification link in your email, you\u0026rsquo;ll be brought back to Github to make a new repository:  Give it a reasonable name; tick the \u0026lsquo;initialize with a readme\u0026rsquo; box, tick off the \u0026lsquo;private\u0026rsquo; box, and hit the green commit button. (Nb It\u0026rsquo;s your choice to choose public OR private):  And on the final page, hit the \u0026lsquo;dismiss\u0026rsquo; button in the \u0026lsquo;Github Actions box\u0026rsquo;  Ta Da! You now have a github account, and you\u0026rsquo;ve created your first repository. Going Forward create a new repository for each week\u0026rsquo;s work/reflection. You can create a new repository from the plus sign in the top right corner:\nnb Remember to tick off the \u0026lsquo;initialize with a readme.md\u0026rsquo; file.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve done that, you\u0026rsquo;ll be at your Github user page:\nAdd me as a collaborator to this and any subsequent private repositories you create for this course:   Private Repo: Then, once you\u0026rsquo;ve clicked on \u0026lsquo;manage access\u0026rsquo;, click on \u0026lsquo;invite collaborator\u0026rsquo;,\n  Private Repo: Then find my username shawngraham, and add me:\n  Setting up a \u0026lsquo;repository\u0026rsquo; for your work A \u0026lsquo;repository\u0026rsquo; is just a folder that you\u0026rsquo;ve shared on Github. There are two ways to do this; the easy way and the more complex way. Luck you, you have already done the easy way - you selected the initialize with a readme, and it\u0026rsquo;s already present in your browser!\nTo create new repositories, just click on the + button on the top right of your Github page when you\u0026rsquo;re logged in. Remember to tick off the initialize with a readme box. Think about whether you want them private or public. But if you didn\u0026rsquo;t tick the initialize box, you\u0026rsquo;ve embarked on the more complex way. In the screenshot below, I created a new repository but I forgot to initialize it, and now I\u0026rsquo;m looking at this page:\nIf this is you, do not despair.\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;ve forgotten to initialize a new repo: You\u0026rsquo;re going to have to install one or two things, and do some work at the command prompt or terminal.\n If you have a PC, click on this link to download and install git. Just use all of the suggested default settings when you run the installer. If you have a Mac, you can install it by opening the terminal program (click on your applications and type \u0026lsquo;terminal\u0026rsquo; in the search window) and then typing in these two commands (or copy and paste). The first command starts at the / and ends at the \u0026quot; and you must include the entire line from slash to closing quotation mark:  /bin/bash -c \u0026quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)\u0026quot; and when that finishes,\nbrew install git Make a new directory on your computer with the same name as the repo you created above. For my screenshotted example above, that would be week-two. On a PC, find the folder in your file explorer; click on it so that\u0026rsquo;s the folder displayed in the address bar at the top of the explorer. Then, click in the address bar and type cmd and hit enter. This will open a command prompt window for that folder, allowing you to type commands in directly. On a Mac, go to System Preferences, select Keyboard \u0026gt; Shortcuts \u0026gt; Services. Look for \u0026lsquo;New Terminal at Folder\u0026rsquo; and tick the box. Open your finder; find the folder you created, right-click and select \u0026lsquo;open Terminal here\u0026rsquo;.  A Quick Primer for Working at the Command Line or Terminal\nThe following two videos, one for PC, one for Mac, show you how to do this. For reference\u0026rsquo;s sake, this is what \u0026lsquo;working at the command prompt\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;working at the terminal\u0026rsquo; look like on your machine. When you interact with your computer, you can do it through a graphical interface - icons, clicks, etc - or you can directly type in commands. It\u0026rsquo;s this latter kind of interaction that most people think of as \u0026lsquo;coding\u0026rsquo;, but for us, this is just \u0026lsquo;opening the hood\u0026rsquo;.\n PC:\n  Mac:\n  Key commands for PC:\n dir show the contents of the current directory cls clear the window so that it\u0026rsquo;s fresh again cd directory-name change director to the named directory cd .. change directory up one level if you hit the up or down arrows you can cycle through the history of commands you\u0026rsquo;ve already typed  Key commands for Mac:\n ls list the contents of the current directory pwd print the path (location) of the current directory cd directory-name change director to the named directory cd .. change directory up one level history prints out the entire history of commands you\u0026rsquo;ve typed this session up and down arrows will cycle through this list  Do you see where, in your browser at github, it says ...or create a new repository on the command line? With your command prompt or terminal open in the appropriate folder on your machine (remember, folders on your machine = repos on github), type in each line exactly as it is there (beginning with echo), hitting enter at the end of each line, in order. If the command works, you\u0026rsquo;ll just be presented with the next prompt. The computer only ever responds when there is output to print - which often means only when there is an error message to report. (nb Git might prompt you to enter your email and name, as it does in the PC video, the first time you ever do this).  Ta da! You can now go to github.com\\\u0026lt;your-user-name\u0026gt;\\your-repo and you\u0026rsquo;ll see it all there tickety boo.\nMaking a new text file on Github You can make a new text file by clicking on the \u0026lsquo;create new file\u0026rsquo; button; remember to always use .md as the file extension. You can specify headers, links, images, bullets, blockquotes and so on by using markdown conventions\nThe two videos below might be a bit clearer on youtube itself.\n  Uploading a file into Github You can add new files from your computer by dragging and dropping them into the main repository. At the end of this video, I show you how to display the image in the text of the reflection.\n  Going further Github can also be used to run an entire website, generated from your text files. In fact, that\u0026rsquo;s how I built this course website! The following three links are from my HIST4806a 2020 seminar on digital history and museums; they will walk you through how to use your Github account to serve up a professional scholarly website; you can use this scholarly website to host your reflections and course work, if you want.

To what purpose? What might happen if we release these collections into the wild (via the internet)? If we mash these collections together what might we see, and why might it matter? Where are the dangers - and to whom could it be dangerous?\nYou do not need to be \u0026lsquo;techy\u0026rsquo; to be successful in this course! You just need to be diligent, honest, and open. This course is not as tech heavy as some of my other classes. Nevertheless, you will be exposed to several platforms, techs, and approaches that you may not have experienced before. The key is to be open and willing to talk about when things don\u0026rsquo;t go as expected.\nYou will read, watch, listen to, and discuss the class materials via various online tools including Hypothes.is and Github (Speaking of Hypothes.is, highlight a word on this page and see what happens). We do not use cuLearn in the course. We work on the open web instead. What is challenging for one student will not necessarily be challenging for another, and I expect you to push yourself and pull others along as you go. Thus open and honest reporting of what works and what hasn’t worked, is a meaningful aspect of this course. Again: You don’t need to be techy to succeed, but you do need to be willing to embrace when things go ‘wrong’.\nMy goal here is to teach you to use certain digital techs; to unpack and interrogate those techs you learn to use; and to equip you to use these things in a reflective manner. It\u0026rsquo;s about history and musuems and informatics, but also, looking at informatics from a perspective grounded in history. It\u0026rsquo;s going to be uncomfortable. There will be things we try here that will not work. That\u0026rsquo;s why part of the exit ticket for this course will be for you to rethink the one part of the course that was most affecting for you to make it better, but also, to think through who it might harm.\nText/Tech To the best of my ability, all materials will either be open access materials on the web or materials made available to us through MacOdrum Library or the University. You will not be required to purchase any set text or software.\nHaving a reasonably up-to-date computer will make life easier for you; if you use a chromebook or a low-powered laptop (eg, less than 8 gb of RAM), this will require us to think creatively about some of the work, but should not present an insurmountable obstacle. A good internet connection will make life easier, but I realize that not everyone is well-served by our tech oligopolies. Please let me know if these situations apply to you so that we can work out a suitable plan of action.\nClass format This class will be delivered online, asynchronously. A Discord server will be used to provide a social context to our work, for help, and for collaboration. Learning materials will be curated on this open course website, and might include a variety of modalities. There will be no required synchronous chats or lectures. Students will maintain various materials on the web via Github (your Github account may be anonymous or pseudonymous or made private provided access is shared with me).\nWhy? I\u0026rsquo;ve taught online for a variety of institutions, using a variety of formats and approaches. I like teaching asnchronously because I believe it is a kinder approach to complex topics, especially when there is a second layer of difficulty - basic digital literacy, in this case - which intersects with the content, my learning goals for you, your own personal situations - in ways I cannot always anticipate or know.\nSince I cannot know these things, I do not believe that I should bludgeon you with content; I do not think that \u0026lsquo;rigour\u0026rsquo; is demonstrated by forcing you to join me at set times; I do not believe that face-to-face work is somehow more \u0026lsquo;scholarly\u0026rsquo; than other kinds of work. Right now, with the world the way it is, I want to build a structure that opens possibility space for you to engage with this topic, and with \u0026lsquo;digital archaeology\u0026rsquo; when you encounter it beyond this course, in ways that will push you forward as a scholar and citizen.\nFor this to work well, it requires you to be on the same page as me. There is a lot of flexibility built into this course, but it does require you to try to push yourself out of your comfort zone. The key thing is always to tie what you\u0026rsquo;re doing with what you\u0026rsquo;re reading and what you\u0026rsquo;re thinking. That \u0026lsquo;second layer of difficulty\u0026rsquo; will come with practice. But how it intersects with everything else: that\u0026rsquo;s where the learning happens.\n\u0026hellip;and that is why this course is the way it is. No doubt, things will break, and some things will work better/be more effective than others. We will roll with it.\n","description":"what to tell your friends","id":13,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"1. Course Description","uri":"https://dhmuse.netlify.app/docs/1-coursedescription/"},{"content":"Questions text to be added\nThis course is a formalized exploration of these questions; I do not know the answers! I\u0026rsquo;m excited to figure these out with you.\nNb The process of teaching is also a process of collaboration between me and you. Sometimes -and we\u0026rsquo;re expecting this, you and I- things won\u0026rsquo;t work as we expect; tech might break; the world might impinge too much. We will adapt accordingly. Remember: the grade in this course is a function of your process and your evolution, so adapting and thinking through the implications of when things don\u0026rsquo;t go according to plan is, in fact, according to plan. Outcomes  Situate the practice, ethical, and intellectual trajectories of informatics within the cultural heritage field Implement and contribute to a ‘GLAM Workbench’, a series of interactive computational notebooks dealing with data from the Ottawa galleries-libraries-archives-museums sector Investigate open data sources, using the methods/techniques/perspectives of digital history and digital humanities Develop how-to for the workbench that communicate the results of these investigations as an act of public digital history Given that this is an online course, another outcome will be your ability to conduct such research independently. However, no one operates in a vacuum; digital historians collaborate to troubleshoot or develop technologies, and through open practices to data sharing and reuse, learn to build upon each others’ work in a collaborative fashion.  Texts to be completed\nReal Names Policy You do not need to use your real name or identity on any public-facing work that you do in this course. Nor do you need to explain to me that you wish to use a pseudonym. It is sufficient that you send an email to me with the following message:\n‘I would like to use the following username in all public-facing work: xxxxxxxx’\n…where xxxxx is the name you have selected. For safety’s sake, if you decide to use a pseudonym, do not use one that you have used on any other website or social media platform.\nWhen Life Intervenes There\u0026rsquo;s nothing we can\u0026rsquo;t roll with, in this class. That said, I can\u0026rsquo;t help you if I don\u0026rsquo;t know you need help, a breathing space, some direction. When something comes up, just let me know:\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to share the details with me. It is enough for me to know that something has intervened.

Course Schedule","uri":"https://dhmuse.netlify.app/docs/3-schedule/"},{"content":"There is no midterm. There is no final exam.\r Outputs to be added\n  Discussion Leaders. Each student will be responsible to \u0026lsquo;page prep\u0026rsquo; cetain readings. Page prep involves:\n Creating the Reading Overview: a brief overview page note attached to the assigned reading using Hypothes.is page notes Creating the Reading Pre-seed: at least five rich annotations on the assigned readings In the relevant week, when the other students read the papers, the student responsible for \u0026lsquo;page prep\u0026rsquo; will engage and respond to the annotations of their peers in such a fashion as to dig deeper into the topic at hand    Collaborative Readers. Each student is responsible each week to respond in a timely fashion (Monday to Wed) to overview annotations and seeded annotations such that the page preparer can respond in turn.\n  Each student will craft at least one Jupyter notebook that engages with a source of GLAM data in Ottawa. See the \u0026lsquo;Technical Notes\u0026rsquo; for more info on the mechanics. The notebook should do something meaningful with the data (at least two examples of \u0026lsquo;something meaningful\u0026rsquo; within a single notebook). It could be a visualization of a certain subset of information. It could show how to map the material. It might make the material more easily available. Other things are possible.\n the notebook will combine both the code and the documentation explaining what is going on, where the data is coming from the jupyter notebook will be kept under version control in Github.    Each student will write one case study using our glam-workbench that walks the user through the notebook, how to use it, and visualize results to suggest questions a user might want to pose, and why it might matter. This will be written as a text file using Markdown conventions, that cites readings and other pertinent materials; it might also link to relevant annotations in our discussions.\n  Each student will prepare an exit ticket reflecting on the entire process (see below).\n  Do not attempt to speedrun this course. By \u0026lsquo;speedrun\u0026rsquo; I mean, you leave it until the end and try to do all of the work in one intense session. Work done in that fashion cannot, by virtue of it all being dumped in my lap at the end of the course, take into account feedback, peer collaboration, or have any meaningful engagement with the materials. Thus, work done in this fashion cannot meet the learning goals of the course, with negative implications for your grade. Do not do this. The Exit Ticket You will produce an \u0026lsquo;exit ticket\u0026rsquo; for me at the end of the course (open format) reflecting on where you started and where you\u0026rsquo;ve gotten to, and you will indicate how you feel you\u0026rsquo;ve done against the learning outcomes; see below for how meeting the outcomes translates to a grade. You are required to explicitly tie your exit ticket to the evidence of your journey (annotations, digital ephemera, etc). The exit ticket is a summary assessment exercise that will pull all the different strings together into a strong cord. Everyone\u0026rsquo;s journey is different. Digital methods are more a matter of practice and time than they are of aptitude.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve never done digital work before, it might be that you never quite manage to get as many of the tech things working as you might\u0026rsquo;ve wanted: but you now know what you didn\u0026rsquo;t know before. That\u0026rsquo;s a win. You might be a computer science minor and the tech materials don\u0026rsquo;t present you with much challenge: but figuring out how to tell the compelling story was very difficult for you but you\u0026rsquo;re better at it now. Your \u0026lsquo;exit ticket\u0026rsquo; will explain to me your particular context, and it will point to the evidence that demonstrates how you\u0026rsquo;ve moved along from where you were at the beginning to where you are now.\nIf I agree with your assessment, then that is the grade you will receive (thus, you have the opportunity to override the percentage breakdowns below).\nWhen I have disagreed in previous courses this has been, 9.5 times out of 10, to raise the grade: y\u0026rsquo;all are too hard on yourselves. If I have disagreed and felt that you\u0026rsquo;ve overstated things - if you were the 0.5 out of 10 - we would talk and come to an agreement.\nThe Exit Ticket should be submitted within one week of the last day of the fall term.\nGrading make sure these agree with the learning outcomes\nRemembering the learning outcomes,\n   Learning Outcome A B C D eg. Jo Q Student     1. analytical ability - - - - X   2. methodology - - - - -   3. collaboration - - - - X   4. argumentation - - - - X   5. professionalization - - - - -    \u0026hellip;5/5 would be an A, 4/5 would be a B, 3/5 would be a C, 2/5 a D.\nIn this example, based on my consideration of Jo Q Student\u0026rsquo;s evidence and the feedback I\u0026rsquo;d written him over the six weeks, it seemed to me that he did what she needed to do (satisfactorily) for 3 out of the 5 outcomes and so earned a C. However, her exit ticket might bring her up. Percentage Breakdown I am required by the University to provide a percentage breakdown.\n Discussion leading: 20% Collaborative reading: 20% Jupyter Notebook: 20% Case Study: 20% Exit Ticket: 20%  I reserve the right to adjust those percentages to take into account the particular circumstances of the student. Note that depending on your argument in the Exit Ticket, I can be persuaded the adjust those percentages to put more weight on one thing rather than another, etc.\n","description":"grading and ungrading","id":16,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"4.

Rather, I am trying to help you learn the skills that you will need to uncover whatever aspect of method and thought that will help you with your research goals. A big part of that is trying to teach how to deal with what might feel like \u0026lsquo;failure\u0026rsquo;, on first blush. I want you to swing for the bleachers, and not to be afraid of whiffing on the ball. After all, to mix sporting metaphors, you\u0026rsquo;re here for icetime not the Stanley Cup.\nOn another note, this course originally was intended to be a kind of hybrid course, blending face to face work in the classroom with resources and digital tools.\nThat of course, can\u0026rsquo;t happen at the moment.\nMoving online just means that I have to work harder at fostering the social aspect of learning and education.\nSocial Contact Another problem with moving fully online is isolation. Working with digital tools and environments, especially when you\u0026rsquo;re not overly familiar with how they work - or even the underlying metaphors that would help you make sense of what\u0026rsquo;s going on - is frustrating. Bad enough when you have classmates you see twice a week and can at least complain with over coffee later; extremely awful when you\u0026rsquo;re on a bad internet connection and everyone thinks that you\u0026rsquo;re not really doing schoolwork.\nIn past classes, I have used Slack as a way of trying to meet that need for human connection that makes learning meaningful. It worked, more or less, but if there was a conversation going on and you missed part of it, it could just feel overwhelming and impenetrable.\nAnd it was one more damned thing to install. One more damned thing to get a password for.\nI tried Zulipchat another year. Same problem again.\nThis year, as I write this, I\u0026rsquo;m trying Discord, for its voice and screensharing integration. We\u0026rsquo;ll see how that goes.\nThis work is a team sport. You are never expected to power through all of this material on your own in heroic scholarly endeavour. If you need help, ask for help; if you can help, offer it. You are not alone.\r This website is built using Hugo, a static site builder. Static sites are quicker, more secure, and separate content from container, thus making them more sustainable. I write all of the content in individual text files, which I can then turn into whatever output - html, pdf, word doc - that I need. My writing is freed from subscription-based software that might lock it in. I push all of the text files onto github (you can see them here.) Then, I have netlify.com watch those files for any changes. When it spots changes, it uses Hugo to turn them into html, and serves them up to the world.\nI am grateful to Chantal Brousseau, who did a road-test of this entire site, checking for dead links and so on, before we went live in January.
