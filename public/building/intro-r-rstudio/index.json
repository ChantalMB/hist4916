This is often accomplished through an ongoing Socratic dialogue with a seminar leader or instructor, or through a more formal presentation of research. It is essentially a place where assigned readings are discussed, questions can be raised and debates can be conducted.\n Thus spake Wikipedia (Wikipedia has a surprising amount of GLAM projects going on by the way).\nOver these next four weeks, we transform that conventional model from live face to face to a distributed, asynchronous model through collaborative reading \u0026amp; generous thinking\nGoals for this week  Engage meaningfully with the discussion as prepared for you by your peers.

They found me, apparently, in the gallery devoted to computers.\nSeems like I\u0026rsquo;ve been a nerd for a very, very long time.\n[ music ]\nWelcome to DHMuse! This course is my attempt to understand the landscape of cultural heritage informatics, especially here in Ottawa. I\u0026rsquo;m glad you\u0026rsquo;ve decided to join me in this attempt. How do museums and other organizations in the ‘GLAM’ sector (galleries, libraries, archives, museums) keep track of their collections? To what purpose? What might happen if we release these collections into the wild (via the internet)? If we mash these collections together what might we see, and why might it matter? Where are the dangers - and to whom could it be dangerous?\nNow, my background is not in museums. You might say, it\u0026rsquo;s museum-adjacent. I\u0026rsquo;m an archaeologist by training and there is of course a natural connection there between archaeologists and museum curators.\n[ clip of Indiana Jones; ] It belongs in a museum!\nBut I\u0026rsquo;m also the official digital humanities guy, the official digital historian, the digital archaeologist, in the department. So I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to learn how all of these different fields intersect, especially with material culture, the things of history. That is, I think I\u0026rsquo;m working maybe in \u0026lsquo;cultural heritage informatics\u0026rsquo;. I hadn\u0026rsquo;t even heard the term until oh around six or seven years ago when I saw Ethan Watrall, an archaeologist at Michigan State University, using it to describe a training programme he\u0026rsquo;d developed for his grad students.\nCultural Heritage Informatics. I like it. It seems to me that the intersection of digital history, material cutlure, museums, galleries, libraries and archives might be found within the broader field of ‘cultural heritage informatics’. Cultural heritage materials require careful description and organization to permit effective curation, preservation, management, and research. You may have heard the term ‘bioinformatics’ before; that field defines itself as\n ‘the interdisciplinary field that studies and pursues the effective uses of biomedical data, information, and knowledge for scientific inquiry, problem solving and decision making, motivated by efforts to improve human health.’ (Kulikowski et al 2012)\n …in which case, we could define CHI similarly as an interdisciplinary field studying and pursuing the effective use of cultural heritage data, information, and knowledge for humanistic or scientific inquiry, problem solving, and decision making, motivated by efforts to improve human welfare. I added the emphasis there to make an important point. The decisions we make about information are necessarily ethical decisions. Computers operate by replicating the decisions we make, at enormous speed and scale. The consequences can be unintended and unforeseen, and so we have to begin from an ethical perspective that considers from the outset: who will this harm?\n[ music ]\nBy now, you\u0026rsquo;ve had a chance to look over this course website. The entire course is designed to be asynchronous; I don\u0026rsquo;t know about you, but I could live happily without ever being in another zoom meeting. But just because this is asynchronous, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that we don\u0026rsquo;t have a time table to keep, a schedule to observe.\nEach week, there are things that need to get done, in order for us to achieve our goals. By the end of this course, I want you to have built a digital computational notebook that engages with information from one of the galleries, libraries, archives, or museums in Ottawa. It might do an analysis; it might be a creative re-imagining; it might be something else entirely.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re taking inspiration from the work of Australian digital historian Tim Sherratt, who has built what he calls the GLAM Workbench. We\u0026rsquo;re going to put together a version of this from these notebooks that you will make. Thanks to the Students as Partners Programme, I\u0026rsquo;ve also been supported in building this course by Chantal Brousseau, who is doing her history degree with a computer science minor. She is also your classmate and another resource person who can help troubleshoot the tech side of things.\nI want to make it clear that you do not need to be techy to be successful in this course. I know that everyone comes with different comfort levels. My concern - and how I grade - is that you are open and honest about what has worked and what hasn\u0026rsquo;t, and that you think through the why of that. I can\u0026rsquo;t emphasize enough: in tech work, we learn far more from when things break than from things that work the first time. I want you to break things.\nIt\u0026rsquo;ll be awesome. Trust me.\nThe first third of this course then will consist of a tune-up of your digital skills. You will also select some materials to explore in more detail, plotting your own adventure through the CHI literature. You\u0026rsquo;ll then prepare detailed annotations of this material to share with everyone else.\nThen, in the second third of the course, we will look at those materials, and respond to your annotations: basically, we will have a distributed conversation around this literature.\nThis will then set us up for the final third of the course where, using our digital skills and grounding the work in the literature we\u0026rsquo;ve just explored, you will create the computational notebook. You will also write documentation that situates that notebook, so that someone might understand the value, utility, and possibilities that the notebook allows.\nAll of these I will bundle up at the end of the course and turn into a website, the Ottawa GLAM Workbench.\nCool, eh?\nAfter you\u0026rsquo;ve finished listening to this podcast, read through the syllabus - it\u0026rsquo;s critically important that you do this, since this class is probably very unlike any others you\u0026rsquo;ve taken - join the class discord, say hello. Read and start following the instructions for week 1. Sort out a github account (which can be pseudonymous, as long as you let me know what your pseudonym is!). Get the hypothesis account, annotate anything you don\u0026rsquo;t understand or are nervous about in the syllabus and the instructions. You\u0026rsquo;re gonna do great. When life intervenes - and it will - just let me know that something\u0026rsquo;s going on. I don\u0026rsquo;t need to know the details; I trust you. Let me know, and we\u0026rsquo;ll come up with alternatives for you to be successful. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing we can\u0026rsquo;t roll with, if you\u0026rsquo;re willing to trust me.\nOne last thing - from time to time there will be a course podcast for you to listen to. I have invited a number of professionals to reflect on their work and share that with us, so that you gain perspective from those in the field.\nToday, we\u0026rsquo;ll finish off by hearing from Erica Vanden Bosch , Manager of Information Management Services for Ingenium, the Crown Corporation that runs the Science and Technology Museum, the Aviation Museum, and the Food and Agriculture Museum.\nPart Two: Erica Vanden Bosch Hello, my name is Erica Vanden Bosch and I work for Ingenium, Canada\u0026rsquo;s museums of science and innovation. We\u0026rsquo;re located right here in Ottawa Ontario and we run three national museums: we have Canada Agriculture and Food museum; Canada Aviation and Space Museum; and Canada Science and Technology museum.\nWhat do I do? I\u0026rsquo;m the manager of Information Management Services and if you don\u0026rsquo;t know what information management means don\u0026rsquo;t worry. I will do my best to tell you what I do and I\u0026rsquo;ll try and keep it short and sweet. Basically, I\u0026rsquo;m responsible for the overall management of information and corporate memory at Ingenium. That covers a huge volume and variety of information. There\u0026rsquo;s documentation related to the collection like acquisition proposals, exhibition development plans and programming materials and there\u0026rsquo;s also documentation generated by our internal services such as finance and human resources.\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s a really broad portfolio. But of course, I don\u0026rsquo;t personally handle each piece of information. We have 200 plus employees from curators to conservation, exhibition to programming, facilities to security. Each of these groups creates, receives, and uses information to carry out their work. My job is to try to impose controls over how the corporation manages its information.\nAnd these controls need to respect any and all requirements that we are subject to. These could be identified in legislation, regulations, policies and countless other sources. So we take into account rules like copyright, information privacy, information security, information disposition, and that\u0026rsquo;s just the name a few areas but the list goes on and on.\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s me and that\u0026rsquo;s what I do. The next prompt I\u0026rsquo;m going to address is to describe a moment where the digital aspect changed how I do my job. Well, I actually graduated from Carleton University with my undergrad bachelor of arts in English. I graduated in 2015, so some of you may be able to relate to this if you\u0026rsquo;re a little bit younger- basically when I entered the workforce digital had already made its grand entrance.\nSo I certainly haven\u0026rsquo;t experienced a digital transformation in the same way some of my colleagues have and it\u0026rsquo;s not that they\u0026rsquo;re haven\u0026rsquo;t been changes. I mean technologies are constantly evolving and we\u0026rsquo;re often undertaking projects that involve changes to our tech. But I would say I learned digital-first.\nAnd as I work, I often find myself looking back at legacy paper versions of a process. Sometimes handling the legacy paper documents that were generated. So I do bounce between worlds but I\u0026rsquo;m definitely more of a digital-first. And what\u0026rsquo;s clear to me is that digital has so much potential.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s really inspiring. We can reach so many more people; we can share so much more information and we can give so much more control to our users and we can let them decide how they want to interact and use the materials that we have. I guess I don\u0026rsquo;t want to suggest that digital is an easy solution- there\u0026rsquo;s certainly lots of work to do and there are certainly challenges but we can certainly use digital tools to make cultural heritage more accessible and more inclusive. I think that\u0026rsquo;s kind of my big takeaway - even though it\u0026rsquo;s normal to feel comfortable with the more traditional ways of working, sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s good to push ourselves out of our comfort zones when we know it\u0026rsquo;s for a good cause.\nSpeaking of digital I\u0026rsquo;ll move to the next point: what\u0026rsquo;s the greatest challenge that I\u0026rsquo;m currently facing with the digital aspect of my work? I think I struggle to pinpoint one single challenge; to be honest, there are endless challenges, overlapping challenges, and even contradictory challenges where solving one issue seems to somehow aggravate another one.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;ll just highlight one challenge, and it\u0026rsquo;s the level of tech skills that varies from person to person. And that\u0026rsquo;s both in the workforce with people I work with and it\u0026rsquo;s also with the public that we serve- you know, there are people who are incredibly tech savvy, but there are also people who willingly admit that they\u0026rsquo;re not tech friendly in this slightest even and those groups of people often want completely different things from their tech, you know, tech savvy people want a lot of sophisticated functionality.\nAnd the less tech savvy people just want it to be super simple and of course, you know, that\u0026rsquo;s a binary and it\u0026rsquo;s it\u0026rsquo;s not as simple as that there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of people in between. Either way it\u0026rsquo;s really challenging to have our products, our services, and our solutions accommodate the varying levels of technical skills across these people. So that\u0026rsquo;s I think the single greatest challenge I\u0026rsquo;d say right now and my advice for that because I don\u0026rsquo;t want to just leave a challenge up in the air would be:\nThat from your own perspective the best thing you can do is to just to ensure that you yourself have the highest tech skills you can, so that you can understand the tech.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s really to your advantage to have that technical know-how and the more advanced your tech skills are, it\u0026rsquo;s gonna help you when you\u0026rsquo;re trying to resolve problems with the tech; it\u0026rsquo;s also gonna help you understand what options are feasible when you\u0026rsquo;re developing new solutions, when your working under resource restraints. I think it\u0026rsquo;ll even help when you\u0026rsquo;re trying to develop new ideas. So that\u0026rsquo;s the challenge and how I would suggest trying to work with it.\nNext up: where do I see cultural heritage informatics in the future? To be honest before I can jump ahead to the future there\u0026rsquo;s still so much groundwork left to do a lot of GLAMs still need to do work to make their information accessible and in machine readable formats even just internally and to make sure it\u0026rsquo;s comprehensive and consistent and clean. You know, a lot of us have pockets of content that are available and ready to go but there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of content waiting on the sidelines to be processed and to be prepared. So that would give us a great foundation if we could get that to kind of catch up with us.\nAnd then after that, I hope in the future cultural heritage informatics is more open. And I mean, I understand it can only be \u0026lsquo;open\u0026rsquo; when it\u0026rsquo;s possible and when it\u0026rsquo;s appropriate to release that content, so you know, not not complete openness, but \u0026lsquo;conscious openness\u0026rsquo;, deliberate openness and then I also hope that GLAMs continue to collaborate widely. I hope we continue to engage specific groups and communities, especially those that have been underrepresented and I hope we continue to provide opportunities for greater public engagement. I mean, personally, I love seeing crowdsourcing initiatives where the public can explore and contribute to collections. I love \u0026lsquo;colab\u0026rsquo; which is a Library and Archives Canada feature on their website, so if you haven\u0026rsquo;t already, check that out.\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s where I at least hope that we\u0026rsquo;re going in the future. And last but not least: \u0026lsquo;what advice might I give to a student who is interested in the intersection of museums and cultural heritage informatics?\u0026rsquo;\nI\u0026rsquo;ll give three pieces of advice. Number one: just look for opportunities to gain experience and be really open about what those may be, whether that means applying to a volunteer organization, whether that\u0026rsquo;s applying to join an advisory council, whether that\u0026rsquo;s applying for a part-time job, it\u0026rsquo;s an opportunity to gain knowledge skills and networks that can serve you and your professional development.\nAdvice number two would be to reflect on other skills that you may bring to the table and then think creatively about ways that you can kind of market them. So maybe you have graphic design skills or creative writing skills, maybe you\u0026rsquo;re proficient in another language, my example is I\u0026rsquo;m a pretty good typer which is a really boring skill! But it\u0026rsquo;s actually given me opportunities that I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have had otherwise, where I\u0026rsquo;ve been asked to take notes at conferences or meetings and I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been asked to attend them, except people deliberately asked me because they thought \u0026lsquo;oh, you could take notes that would be great\u0026rsquo; and I got exposure to these meetings really early in my career I guess because of this skill set that I had! So be creative about what skills you bring to the table and how they can help move you along.\nAnd last but not least is just to be flexible and adaptable. Again kind of underscoring this whole idea of just be really open to opportunities, you know, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to have to have your first job in a museum to start working on skills that will serve you in the GLAM arena. Don\u0026rsquo;t discount any opportunities and just make the most of everything that comes your way. So, thank you so much for listening today. Have a great day.\n","description":"","id":12,"section":"transcripts","tags":null,"title":"4916a W21 Episode 1","uri":"https://dhmuse.netlify.app/transcripts/episode1/"},{"content":"Transcript of this week\u0026rsquo;s podcast episode.\nPart One So this week is an important week in the class. This is the week where you get to choose your own DHMuse adventure. And by choose your own adventure. I mean- you know the first time I did this class I had a huge list of readings that I wanted everybody to get through. It was in fact quite overwhelming. Both for the students and for myself. So we\u0026rsquo;re going to do it differently this time.\nThis time I want you to take a look at our library of materials, which you can find on the website, and select three of the possible readings there that seem to intersect with you and your interests from at least two of the different areas.\nAnd then you go to the choose your own DH Muse Adventure website, click on the big plus sign, which will open up a little panel, very much like Tumblr, a little box for you to enter in put your materials in there. And then, We will look at these things and we will arrange them into a schedule that makes thematic sense by consensus.\nAnd we\u0026rsquo;ll do that [consensus] in the discord space, okay? So there\u0026rsquo;ll be a lot of talking a lot of back and forth in there. And then I\u0026rsquo;ll add connections to the different, the different panels. So that we can see it and I\u0026rsquo;ll update the website with the relevant weeks on the course.\nSo that, It all gets settled out. So that\u0026rsquo;s the first task for this week. The second task is I want you to go to Tim Sherratt\u0026rsquo;s Glam workbench and just explore it. See what he has done; get a sense of the possibilities; look at how he has engaged with GLAM materials from Australia and New Zealandm and think about- especially- the kinds of tacit knowledge, the hidden steps, the little gotchas that are required to be made explicit for you in order to get through this stuff.\nOkay, so that\u0026rsquo;s the task for this week.\n","description":"","id":13,"section":"transcripts","tags":null,"title":"4916a W21 Episode 2","uri":"https://dhmuse.netlify.app/transcripts/episode2/"},{"content":"Transcript of this week\u0026rsquo;s podcast episode.\nPart One Hey everybody, welcome to week three of the course. In this week, we have two major tasks ahead of us. This is the first of two weeks where you can prep your materials for our asynchronous seminar discussions coming up. It\u0026rsquo;s also the first week where you have an opportunity to start polishing or developing your digital skills in particular. We\u0026rsquo;re going to use what are called Jupiter notebooks, these are well, they\u0026rsquo;re interesting. They are like little pieces of code that you can run in a piece of documentation.\nJust kind of an awkward way of saying: it\u0026rsquo;s like a lab notebook where you have your observations and your actual code mixed together so that somebody else can read your work and actually see your observations or run your analysis at the same time. It might feel a bit intimidating and it\u0026rsquo;s okay to feel like that - I found these things intimidating when I started playing with them a few years ago.\nI also have to admit any of the digital skills I have come from screwing around with the computer and talking about what hasn\u0026rsquo;t worked in public because I\u0026rsquo;m a one-man band for the most part. When things go wrong for me, I have to talk to people online and say, \u0026ldquo;uh, anybody? Can anybody help me out here? I don\u0026rsquo;t understand what I\u0026rsquo;ve done.\u0026rsquo;\nAnd you know you learn more to when something breaks because when it breaks that\u0026rsquo;s when you realize, \u0026lsquo;okay, this is the assumption that\u0026rsquo;s been built in here, they\u0026rsquo;re assuming that I already know that I need to install X Y and Z before I can even do this, ah for God\u0026rsquo;s sakes\u0026rsquo;.\nI want you to really understand that it\u0026rsquo;s okay for things to break in this class. It\u0026rsquo;s okay for you not to really quite get it at first. IT\u0026rsquo;S OKAY. I don\u0026rsquo;t grade according to \u0026lsquo;does this notebook work the first time\u0026rsquo;; no I don\u0026rsquo;t do that. I\u0026rsquo;m interested in your process, about how you deal with it, how you think about it, about what the experience has suggested for you; because contrary to what the tech industry will have you believe, nobody is a genius. The tech industry will advertise for a coding ninja, a wizard, a unicorn, and that\u0026rsquo;s\u0026hellip; just bullshit.\nThey do this because they\u0026rsquo;re trying to enhance the prestige of the position and I\u0026rsquo;m all in favor of prestige - we want to feel good about the work that we do - but they make it sound as if there\u0026rsquo;s something inherent in you that prevents you from from doing code. Code is just a matter of exposure and practice and what I\u0026rsquo;m interested in, in this course is giving you that opportunity to practice, to play with things, to have them break, to think about why it breaks, and to do it within the broader context of the the GLAM sector and how it deals with digital stuff.\nSo this week go out and break things. That is the point. Okay? We\u0026rsquo;re far more interested in something that doesn\u0026rsquo;t work and trying to understand why it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work than in something that works that just goes the first time and you don\u0026rsquo;t understand why it did what it did, right? What\u0026rsquo;s the point in that?\nSo, please give yourself time to to work through those tutorials, but give yourself permission to be okay with it not really working at first. Give yourself permission to reach out to somebody else in the class, to a friend, to somebody in your family or, God forbid, even me; you can talk to me to say, \u0026lsquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t quite get why this isn\u0026rsquo;t coming together.\u0026rsquo;\nKeep track of error messages. Take screenshots. Put this stuff into a repo that you can share the link to to say, hey can somebody help me out? Talk about it in discord. I want you to be resilient and resilience is built by experimenting by looking at what hasn\u0026rsquo;t worked, and by talking about it.\nNobody is going to attack you in this class for code stuff not working. Okay? We\u0026rsquo;re in this together and you will learn far more by talking about what hasn\u0026rsquo;t worked than by trying to do it in splendid isolation. In fact, if I find out that you\u0026rsquo;ve been working on it for hours without success and without talking to anybody about it, well, I\u0026rsquo;ll be really disappointed because that will have been time that you didn\u0026rsquo;t need to be stressed about, that you didn\u0026rsquo;t need to feel helpless about.\nIf it doesn\u0026rsquo;t come after 30 minutes it\u0026rsquo;s not gonna come after three hours and I am 100% serious about this. Close the computer go for a walk go do something else. Come back with fresh eyes, and then share the problem with somebody else. Talk to me. Okay. It\u0026rsquo;s gonna be great as long as we keep talking to each other.\nPart Two SG- Today we are joined by Dan Pet from the FitzWilliam Museum at Cambridge University. So I just wanted to ask you. Who are you in and what do you do at your institution?\nDP- That\u0026rsquo;s a good question to start with, who am I; I\u0026rsquo;m not really sure sometimes. I\u0026rsquo;m Daniel Pett and I run the digital and IT for the FitzWilliam museum at Cambridge University. It\u0026rsquo;s the principal art museum at the university and it houses objects from antiquity to modern art to Rodin and Degas. I\u0026rsquo;ve got background from various different things. I started off straight after University where I studied archaeology working in investment banking on a trading floor doing digital IT. And that\u0026rsquo;s terrible boring and then I\u0026rsquo;ve moved into working with British Museum and I was there for 15 years and then that time I met the amazing Shawn Graham and I\u0026rsquo;ve now moved to the University of Cambridge to run IT and digital there. I\u0026rsquo;ve been there for about two years. So I\u0026rsquo;ve been working for nearly two decades and that makes me feel incredibly old.\nSG- Nah, you\u0026rsquo;re still a spring chicken Dan, You\u0026rsquo;re still a spring chicken. So you\u0026rsquo;re the digital IT manager of the Fitzwilliam, what\u0026rsquo;s the greatest challenge you currently face in terms of the digital aspect of this work?\nDP- The world\u0026rsquo;s changed substantially, we\u0026rsquo;re all stuck at home with COVID-19 and the challenges that brings. I think the biggest challenge we have well probably not just the museums but just generally is about the digital divide and people learning how to use new tools, skills, confidence, transitioning from being say, very face-to-face, analogue Facebook and paper -there is a lot of paper still be used in museums lot of notebooks being used - and transitioning to using these tools seamlessly and being able to be confident. So the challenge has been about getting people to work at home with their own equipment; a lot of people don\u0026rsquo;t have their own PC at home or own a Mac or whatever sort of computer. Just before we went into lockdown for the museum I did a survey of our staff to find out what sort of equipment they had and it turned out about 60% of people had access to equipment to use the internet. Now, that\u0026rsquo;s that\u0026rsquo;s quite staggering really 60% - what we are the 40% doing for their internet usage?\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s pretty interesting question for all of you, whether you can get in the library, whether they\u0026rsquo;re using it just at the museum and devices there or whether they\u0026rsquo;re going to friends\u0026rsquo; houses or stealing broadband, which is what some people were doing, so they were using the neighbors Wi-Fi without people finding out about it, so that\u0026rsquo;s an interesting challenge that we\u0026rsquo;re having to face at the moment and I imagine that\u0026rsquo;s pretty the same in Canada, poor bandwidth and local rural areas as well.\nIf we\u0026rsquo;d\u0026rsquo;ve been home two years ago and I had to work at full-time here, I\u0026rsquo;d have had 1.2 megabytes per second bandwidth speed. And not being able to do any of the work I do now, so I couldn\u0026rsquo;t be talking to Shawn now for instance.\nSo the challenges are quite varied. So the next thing we\u0026rsquo;ve gone on to is - we have a very very old building. It\u0026rsquo;s from 1800s and it needs new cabling put into it to make it useable for 21st century. That\u0026rsquo;s quite hard to do because it\u0026rsquo;s listed so we\u0026rsquo;re trying to do that during lock down as well, of course, we can\u0026rsquo;t go to the building because we\u0026rsquo;re not allowed to be there.\nAnd then other challenges I\u0026rsquo;ve got are about enabling people to do new things over the internet as well so we decided we\u0026rsquo;d like a new website during lockdown, we decided we\u0026rsquo;d like to do this we need digital programs, stuff Shawn\u0026rsquo;s class can probably do without even thinking about it. I think about the podcast or maybe learning how to use twine and all these things that you\u0026rsquo;re going to learn about probably doing the course, stories and narratives it\u0026rsquo;s a really interesting period right to think about how the internet can enable us to do new things how we can do about knowledge and I think that\u0026rsquo;s something that courses that you are doing with Shawn will enable you to go out into the workforce now to do these things that we can\u0026rsquo;t do now without lots of teaching and it\u0026rsquo;s quite inspiring to go to Shawn\u0026rsquo;s lessons and lectures and to learn new things and see that he struggles with stuff, sometimes, he\u0026rsquo;s about failure and that\u0026rsquo;s something that I also struggle with for work. I can\u0026rsquo;t talk about failure very often because they want everything to work whereas as I\u0026rsquo;d like to experiment and fail and learn new things let\u0026rsquo;s say this didn\u0026rsquo;t work but this did. And that\u0026rsquo;s probably another great challenge for me, about teaching people that failure is actually okay and we fail a little all the time our lives but why can\u0026rsquo;t we at work?\nSG: So I can imagine the challenges of trying to teach people to fail in your context, so maybe we could talk a little bit about what does a day in the life of Dan Pett look like in your role in your work?\nDP: Would you like pre-covid or right now?\nSG: This is the world we live in now so.\nDP: So at the moment I\u0026rsquo;ve got two children who are both a primary school agent. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what that\u0026rsquo;s called in Canada, that\u0026rsquo;s the primary school. So the first thing is to get them school in the morning, that\u0026rsquo;s the biggest challenge of the day. Tantrums start by nine o\u0026rsquo;clock and I\u0026rsquo;m ready to give up for the day. So we get the kids to school and then I get back upstairs to my office, I live in a countryside, I\u0026rsquo;ve got great view of my office over the village I can see the church actually the school my garden and then we probably start with multiple team calls in the morning. I probably don\u0026rsquo;t concentrate fully through all those calls and I might be doing coding and other things that come in over the night and I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing lots of development work recently based around a new website using some interesting technologies and trying to use Amazon web services. I think Shawn\u0026rsquo;s probably used Amazon web services for a few things and knows it can be quite frustrating trying and that goes back to what we said earlier about failure\nSo teach myself how to fail and break things. So I can prove and teach other people how to use information and resources. We have lots and lots of planning meetings at the moment about what we\u0026rsquo;re going to do about how we react to covid-19, how you bring ticketing people back into the building when we\u0026rsquo;re actually allowed to open. So in the UK I don\u0026rsquo;t know what it\u0026rsquo;s like in Canada we\u0026rsquo;re actually locked out from the museum, we\u0026rsquo;re in our second phase of lockdown now. So people cannot go into the building until December the third I think the date.\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s our second go of lockdown, so obviously museums have lost revenue over that time. But we\u0026rsquo;ve been quite fortunate, we\u0026rsquo;re funded through the university, we\u0026rsquo;re not completely reliant on ticket sales, we don\u0026rsquo;t charge. And we don\u0026rsquo;t sell a huge amount in our shop in terms of millions of pounds.\nSo that could mean carying on quite like normal and the plan is that we redeploy members of staff to do digitally focussed roles and help me with our digitalization programs with our public facing digital outputs. Now, what\u0026rsquo;s the instant challenges that you can imagine - you\u0026rsquo;ve got people who work in front of house, who might not even use a computer, the challenges teaching the skills to actually do these things in the first place.\nI have a team of three people in digital IT. Three people doesn\u0026rsquo;t go very far to teach another 150 people when you have to teach them one to one. So lots of our time at the moment is about bringing people up to speed and how they can learn new things so we can learn how to use say the collection management system.\nWe could spend a couple hours a day just sorting out IT problems and you feel like you\u0026rsquo;re not achieving for yourself, but then you have to remember you\u0026rsquo;re achieving things for other people. And that\u0026rsquo;s the frustrating thing, you do get stuck with the idea \u0026lsquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t achieve anything\u0026rsquo; but actually you did achieve something. So it can be very frustrating for me as well because I think I\u0026rsquo;ve got this amount of time safe, then someone gives me a call and I\u0026rsquo;m not gonna get anything done because I\u0026rsquo;m spending a certain time doing all the work that they need to do.\nAnd the other stuff that we\u0026rsquo;re really up to the moment is grant applications.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re trying to find money to do the new things. Things that we want to do, taking the museum outside the walls of the space and doing virtual tours, doing podcasts, doing it anything that can take the information out into new mediums and say you can\u0026rsquo;t come into our building but you can still experience it. Now I think museums and venues are a little bit fixated on that pyshical space and they haven\u0026rsquo;t thought about millions of people who don\u0026rsquo;t come to their building in a very holistic way yet. So challenges for us and what I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about lots at the moment about how we can change our physical analogue delivery to digital and work at how we can actually say \u0026lsquo;hey Shawn you should come to our museum, your students should come to our museum!\u0026rsquo; What is our museum and that\u0026rsquo;s the idea, \u0026lsquo;what is the idea of a museum\u0026rsquo; and that is changing quite rapidly now for a lot of people: is it digital? is it a hybrid? is it a broadcast or narrowcasting organization? and these are really interesting challenges to think about on the job. And then once that\u0026rsquo;s finished you don\u0026rsquo;t really get a home/work life balance anymore because you are working from home, so you just go back upstairs and do some more work and evening when you\u0026rsquo;re trying to avoid the kids or there\u0026rsquo;s nothing on TV you just end up working in bed and then get up again.\nSo it is quite an interesting time and I\u0026rsquo;m sure you\u0026rsquo;re going to the same sort of thing with your students you are doing a lot more work because you can, because you are home, you\u0026rsquo;re not commuting back into the museum. If I was working in Cambridge I\u0026rsquo;d be commuting five hours a day, how can you five hours a day five hours back, so I\u0026rsquo;m a bit more productive-\nSG: I\u0026rsquo;m sorry you commute five hours to get to Cambridge?\nDP: Yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s not that far, it\u0026rsquo;s seventy miles it\u0026rsquo;s about two and a half hours drive each way unless the traffic\u0026rsquo;s really bad. When I worked in London it was half an hour on the train, though the same distance roughly. So you could say I\u0026rsquo;m either crazy or dedicated\nSG: Let\u0026rsquo;s go back to your your thoughts about where the museum is going um, and can I ask you where do you see cultural heritage informatics if we can use that label as a as a broader field beyond just museums? Where do you see that heading in the future?\nDP: I thought you\u0026rsquo;re gonna stitch me up and what digital humanities is going to do but that\u0026rsquo;s a more interesting question. I think institutions have all got their own strengths and we were facing a little bit different challenges at the moment, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of layoffs happening in the digital world across cultural organizations but there\u0026rsquo;s also this idea that we have to become digital but how do you do that without the staff to do that in the first place? so I think we are going to see a digital revolution based around this time where organizations are gonna changes themselves from this analogue fixated must be the workplace style to working from a house digitally and collaboratively and this is something I think archaeology is managed quite well in many cases. There\u0026rsquo;s projects that we\u0026rsquo;ve worked on, for instance thinking of the Ancient World Data Institute to MSU\u0026rsquo;s digital archaeology practice where you have learned to work with your peers, and I think these people have come together at these workshops have gone away with the idea that we can collaborate across the channel with multiple people even though they have low bandwidth, projects where not everyone\u0026rsquo;s got the same equity of access to resources but you try bring them into that project through either email IRC or any other way of talking to each other. But it\u0026rsquo;s gonna be quite a big challenge because there\u0026rsquo;s not enough people to go around with that digital knowledge who are prepared to share it and I think this is something that we need to be quite careful about is about how we make people transfer what they\u0026rsquo;re doing to other people.\nSo you\u0026rsquo;re excellent, you write things about what you\u0026rsquo;re doing, posting it to the internet. I try to do that but I find that my time gets delayed in sharing so I post a little things on Twitter saying this is what I\u0026rsquo;ve done, here\u0026rsquo;s a gist [gist.github.com], you can copy my work there. and I think organizations got to think more holistically about their peers and start doing more stuff with open source and documenting what they\u0026rsquo;re up to, and sharing what they\u0026rsquo;re doing. So American foundations and more American funding bodies seem quite good about funding universities and scholars to make software, but it\u0026rsquo;s available for other people to use.\nSo things like the Knight Foundation, the Getty, stuff that arches things like that are available for everyone to use so if you think about maybe the UK and perhaps European funding - that stuff doesn\u0026rsquo;t really make it into what people are using so I think this is where things will change. We\u0026rsquo;re all striving to do common things - learning how to make podcast is actually quite hard for people to do. But if people start sharing it, like on the Programming Historian, then we will all get better and then we\u0026rsquo;ll get a deluge of content and where do find your signal in the noise?\nThat that\u0026rsquo;s the thing we\u0026rsquo;re all doing the same stuff and how do you stand out? that\u0026rsquo;s where it becomes interesting. Your institution has got an interesting story to tell- how do you make that narrative stand out from the crowd? You could be the biggest museum in the world but be boring, I mean you listen to some of national museum podcast and didn\u0026rsquo;t really like that, look at the video and think didn\u0026rsquo;t really hit what I wanted to hear and then someone does that massive sheep tweet sort of thing and it goes viral around the world. How\u0026rsquo;d you know, if your content is going to be the next big thing? you don\u0026rsquo;t really do you. You\u0026rsquo;re very often quite lucky to get to that and I think that\u0026rsquo;s something that you can sort of instil in your students this serendipity as well, you don\u0026rsquo;t know how people use your resources so if you\u0026rsquo;re open with everything put it out there at least someone\u0026rsquo;s got chance to reuse so that brings me to the next part (in my head), about open licensing and resources as well. That hopefully will see more people being open about their stuff, they\u0026rsquo;re still making the money. And I think what people don\u0026rsquo;t really get at the moment is about creative common type licensing that you could put out assets under a certain license at some part of your work - that doesn\u0026rsquo;t cover everything that you\u0026rsquo;ve got you can always put out something under a different license at a higher resolution say, this is all rights restricted this stuff is creative commons, and I think people haven\u0026rsquo;t really got that in their mind at the moment.\nAnd maybe we\u0026rsquo;ll see a change with that over time and I think collaborative stuff with Wikipedia might get more help well during this period learn more things infrastructure is not there for organizations to do their own website or do their own stuff, so go where the platform is. one thing that we\u0026rsquo;ve talked about regularly in various things we\u0026rsquo;ve been to is about that quote from Steve blank about \u0026lsquo;build it and they will come\u0026rsquo; is not a strategy, it\u0026rsquo;s a prayer. I think lots of places are still building stuff, hoping people will come. so audience research is very much a key thing asking people what they want and that\u0026rsquo;s something I\u0026rsquo;m trying to do now with the FitzWilliam\u0026rsquo;s new beta website is I want to ask the audience what they want.\nNow the problem I\u0026rsquo;m having at the moment is the audience aren\u0026rsquo;t talking to me and I\u0026rsquo;m not getting any feedback. I knew that was a risk and is that perhaps because the institution in the past has been very staid or standoffish? are we not asking questions in the right way yet? are we not promoting ourselves as well? have we got an audience that does not want to come to our website could be the question really so I think that\u0026rsquo;s one of the key things we\u0026rsquo;ve got to think about over time is about why we create something in the first place. And who it\u0026rsquo;s for, and what our goals are.\nmaybe we don\u0026rsquo;t have a fundamental question about why we did something in the first place so don\u0026rsquo;t do it really because you\u0026rsquo;ve got to have that hypothesis. it\u0026rsquo;s academic as well, isn\u0026rsquo;t it in how you structure it, it\u0026rsquo;s got to have the introduction and the body and then the conclusion about where you get to and is it an on-going project or is it one of those short things that is going to be done and then forgotten about and do we preserve it over time?\n[transcription from this point is automatic]\nNow that goes back to what I was talking about earlier with you and talking presentation you document your projects and your failures and your success what do you learn more from sure you learn from when it breaks, of course exactly when it breaks you exit and someone else might go to help you and I think that is something you and your students are not going to be afraid of the end of your course you can break stuff and actually if student gave me an essay explaining why they failed I\u0026rsquo;ll find that former interest in the one that says this is actually passed all the way through exhaust now what struggles they had and how they thought laterally and what they\u0026rsquo;ve actually.\nSprayed me to get to the point they preview something that works at the end of it but I really interested in where it went wrong on the way and we all make mistakes so recently our Instagram was hacked because someone made a mistake with a fishing attack and gave them the username and password and number because they said we were verified the account it looked plausible and if it\u0026rsquo;s hard it\u0026rsquo;s late at night and you\u0026rsquo;re working hard you can make mistakes but we\u0026rsquo;ve documented it so this is what happened hoping won\u0026rsquo;t make them stay mistake, so just be open about what you\u0026rsquo;re doing.\nNothing quite a lot there sorry well that was really good because the last question. I wanted to ask you was about advice you might. Be student interested in the intersection of the zones and cultural heritage informatics, so one part of that place clearly sounds like don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to fail but document it and talk openly and honestly about it.\nBut is there anything else you might you might off. Um, well, I think just be that failure point is it\u0026rsquo;s got to be about teaching other people that failure is okay as well not coming in and just saying you can fail you have to convince your colleagues who are perhaps not of that culture that you can fail this project and funders as well because funders want you to succeed so you have to come up with this thing this might break at some point and this is what we\u0026rsquo;re trying to do when we think this will work that\u0026rsquo;s something you have to think about.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve lost track of what\u0026rsquo;s gonna say this one so I just I wonder you know maybe we would have more attraction if we stopped using the word fail and failure could we come up with a euphemism that is more palatable or research and development will cover that doesn\u0026rsquo;t in many ways it\u0026rsquo;s like you\u0026rsquo;re you\u0026rsquo;re researching to get to a point developer product and on that you\u0026rsquo;re only you will have pitfalls in the road and things will not always go right because you can\u0026rsquo;t imagine the big firms like and any of the big picture haven\u0026rsquo;t had a failure on the way.\nI mean, you think about projects that Google? Or bad so you remember as buzz and wave and all these things that we all went well, that\u0026rsquo;s God called. Where\u0026rsquo;s it now, it\u0026rsquo;s built there is it so so people do have problems along the way. I think there\u0026rsquo;s so much stuff that.\nI\u0026rsquo;m for your students because they\u0026rsquo;re going to become physically immersed and taught new skills there are quite scarce at one point, they\u0026rsquo;re not going to be a scarcity in the cave in 19 as they were before because people didn\u0026rsquo;t have these skills having to learn them from. But you\u0026rsquo;re going to have a grounding in the theory that goes with it and why you should do this stuff don\u0026rsquo;t actually explain why this tool might not be the best thing for the job so someone might come up with you to say virtual reality is the key for our museum for the future but you might say well what sort of installation you\u0026rsquo;re going to do is gonna be a physical one big beard station well, should we do a web blew?\nAugmented reality instead and are we gonna put headsets out for people to put on they you might instantly save all headsets can\u0026rsquo;t wear those at this time can we but they\u0026rsquo;re always around it with copy 19 so you could put a very extremely clean cleaning program instance but I think people still shy away from it, but you could could talk about new things that people might want to try instead and about what might be the best solution or who other people could be to talk to I think from your course and from your contacts your students will have a good grounding network, but people who they could talk to ask questions and I think it\u0026rsquo;s what Nothing you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be scared of is asking people questions you\u0026rsquo;ve never met before as well and that\u0026rsquo;s where social media is actually become really useful for us so the things that I\u0026rsquo;ve been involved with over the last 10 years.\n","description":"","id":14,"section":"transcripts","tags":null,"title":"4916a W21 Episode 3","uri":"https://dhmuse.netlify.app/transcripts/episode3/"},{"content":"      A clever bit of visual juxtaposition. Yes\u0026hellip;? Anyone\u0026hellip;?\n(Photos by Scott Web https://unsplash.com/photos/ab80p262fFM and Ilya Pavlov https://unsplash.com/photos/OqtafYT5kTw )\nHIST4916a Museums and Digital History How do museums and other organizations in the ‘GLAM’ sector (galleries, libraries, archives, museums) keep track of their collections? To what purpose? What might happen if we release these collections into the wild (via the internet)? If we mash these collections together what might we see, and why might it matter? Where are the dangers - and to whom could it be dangerous?\nWhat is Cultural Heritage Informatics? The intersection of digital history and museums might be found within the broader field of ‘cultural heritage informatics’. Cultural heritage materials require careful description and organization to permit effective curation, preservation, management, and research. You may have heard the term ‘bioinformatics’ before; that field defines itself as\n ‘the interdisciplinary field that studies and pursues the effective uses of biomedical data, information, and knowledge for scientific inquiry, problem solving and decision making, motivated by efforts to improve human health.’ (Kulikowski et al 2012)\n …in which case, we could define CHI similarly as an interdisciplinary field studying and pursuing the effective use of cultural heritage data, information, and knowledge for humanistic or scientific inquiry, problem solving, and decision making, motivated by efforts to improve human welfare. I added the emphasis there to make an important point. The decisions we make about information are necessarily ethical decisions. Computers operate by replicating the decisions we make, at enormous speed and scale. The consequences can be unintended and unforeseen, and so we have to begin from an ethical perspective that considers from the outset: who will this harm?\nYou do not need to be \u0026lsquo;techy\u0026rsquo; to be successful in this course! You just need to be diligent, honest, and open. This course is not as tech heavy as some of my other classes. Nevertheless, you will be exposed to several platforms, techs, and approaches that you may not have experienced before. The key is to be open and willing to talk about when things don\u0026rsquo;t go as expected.\nYou will read, watch, listen to, and discuss the class materials via various online tools including Hypothes.is and Github (Speaking of Hypothes.is, highlight a word on this page and see what happens). We do not use cuLearn in the course. We work on the open web instead. What is challenging for one student will not necessarily be challenging for another, and I expect you to push yourself and pull others along as you go. Thus open and honest reporting of what works and what hasn’t worked, is a meaningful aspect of this course. Again: You don’t need to be techy to succeed, but you do need to be willing to embrace when things go ‘wrong’.\nMy goal here is to teach you to use certain digital techs; to unpack and interrogate those techs you learn to use; and to equip you to use these things in a reflective manner. It\u0026rsquo;s about history and musuems and informatics, but also, looking at informatics from a perspective grounded in history. It\u0026rsquo;s going to be uncomfortable. There will be things we try here that will not work. That\u0026rsquo;s why the assessment for this course is built around the process, not the final product.\nText/Tech To the best of my ability, all materials will either be open access materials on the web or materials made available to us through MacOdrum Library or the University. You will not be required to purchase any set text or software.\nHaving a reasonably up-to-date computer will make life easier for you; if you use a chromebook or a low-powered laptop (eg, less than 8 gb of RAM), this will require us to think creatively about some of the work, but should not present an insurmountable obstacle. A good internet connection will make life easier, but I realize that not everyone is well-served by our tech oligopolies. Please let me know if these situations apply to you so that we can work out a suitable plan of action.\nClass format This class will be delivered online, asynchronously. A Discord server will be used to provide a social context to our work, for help, and for collaboration. Learning materials will be curated on this open course website, and might include a variety of modalities. There will be no required synchronous chats or lectures. There might be optional ones. Students will maintain various materials on the web via Github (your Github account may be anonymous or pseudonymous or made private provided access is shared with me).\nWhy? I\u0026rsquo;ve taught online for a variety of institutions, using a variety of formats and approaches. I like teaching asynchronously because I believe it is a kinder approach to complex topics, especially when there is a second layer of difficulty - basic digital literacy, in this case - which intersects with the content, my learning goals for you, your own personal situations - in ways I cannot always anticipate or know.\nSince I cannot know these things, I do not believe that I should bludgeon you with content; I do not think that \u0026lsquo;rigour\u0026rsquo; is demonstrated by forcing you to join me at set times; I do not believe that face-to-face work is somehow more \u0026lsquo;scholarly\u0026rsquo; than other kinds of work. Right now, with the world the way it is, I want to build a structure that opens possibility space for you to engage with this topic, and with CHI when you encounter it beyond this course, in ways that will push you forward as a scholar and citizen.\nFor this to work well, it requires you to be on the same page as me. There is a lot of flexibility built into this course, but it does require you to try to push yourself out of your comfort zone. The key thing is always to tie what you\u0026rsquo;re doing with what you\u0026rsquo;re reading and what you\u0026rsquo;re thinking. That \u0026lsquo;second layer of difficulty\u0026rsquo; will come with practice. But how it intersects with everything else: that\u0026rsquo;s where the learning happens.\n\u0026hellip;and that is why this course is the way it is. No doubt, things will break, and some things will work better/be more effective than others. We will roll with it.\n","description":"what to tell your friends","id":15,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"1. Course Description","uri":"https://dhmuse.netlify.app/docs/1-coursedescription/"},{"content":"Questions How do institutions in the GLAM sector use digital media to support their missions?\nDo digital techs push us towards particular voices in GLAM materials?\nCan/do digital techs in the service of GLAM harm different communities? And if so, how? And what can we do about it?\nWhere are the new frontiers in CHI and GLAM?\nThis course is an opportunity to explore these questions; I do not know the answers! I\u0026rsquo;m excited to figure these out with you. Why not annotate this section with some of your own questions?\nNb The process of teaching is also a process of collaboration between me and you. Sometimes -and we\u0026rsquo;re expecting this, you and I- things won\u0026rsquo;t work as we expect; tech might break; the world might impinge too much. We will adapt accordingly. Remember: the grade in this course is a function of your process and your evolution, so adapting and thinking through the implications of when things don\u0026rsquo;t go according to plan is, in fact, according to plan. Outcomes  Situate the practice, ethical, and intellectual trajectories of informatics within the cultural heritage field Implement and contribute to a ‘GLAM Workbench’, a series of interactive computational notebooks dealing with data from the Ottawa galleries-libraries-archives-museums sector Investigate open data sources, using the methods/techniques/perspectives of digital history and digital humanities Develop a how-to for the workbench that communicate the results of these investigations as an act of public digital history Given that this is an online course, another outcome will be your ability to conduct such research independently. However, no one operates in a vacuum; digital historians collaborate to troubleshoot or develop technologies, and through open practices to data sharing and reuse, learn to build upon each others’ work in a collaborative fashion.  Real Names Policy You do not need to use your real name or identity on any public-facing work that you do in this course. Nor do you need to explain to me why you wish to use a pseudonym. It is sufficient that you send an email to me with the following message:\n‘I would like to use the following username in all public-facing work: xxxxxxxx’\n…where xxxxx is the name you have selected. No questions asked. For safety’s sake, if you decide to use a pseudonym, do not use one that you have used on any other website or social media platform.\nWhen Life Intervenes There\u0026rsquo;s nothing we can\u0026rsquo;t roll with, in this class. That said, I can\u0026rsquo;t help you if I don\u0026rsquo;t know you need help, a breathing space, some direction. When something comes up, just let me know.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to share the details with me. It is enough for me to know that something has intervened. I trust you.\r When something comes up and this course has to move to the backburner, contact me and we can figure out something else to do, or something else that will help you be successful here. It\u0026rsquo;s our course - we can change things up as we need to.\n","description":"what you'll get out of this course","id":16,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"2.

This document will be integrated into the workbench after the class is finished.\nHeritageJam Last year, when I ran this course, the idea was to use the course as a platform to launch the HeritageJam event, with online and in-person components. The pandemic of course kiboshed that. This year, I still want to run HeritageJam, and I\u0026rsquo;d like to have our Ottawa GlAM Workbench play a central role as a resource for a fully-online event. I have funds to support this, and I hope to be able to hire one or two of you to help develop the Ottawa GLAM Workbench further, and to help put the event on.\nBut we\u0026rsquo;ll see; just mark this as TBD.\n","description":"what we are working towards","id":17,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"3.

You will do a deep annotation on the materials.\nThe second third will be our asynchronous rotating discussion, conducted in the threads of the various annotations each of us will have prepped on our materials. In a given week, the focus will shift from one batch of materials to another as we discuss collaboratively.\nThe final third will when we build our GLAM workbench; the \u0026lsquo;notebook\u0026rsquo; pages will be accompanied by documentation explaining how to use them, what a user might find, and tie this discussion into the literature we explored.\n","description":"what happens when, and where","id":18,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"4.

See the \u0026lsquo;Technical Notes\u0026rsquo; for more info on the mechanics. The notebook should do something meaningful with the data (at least two examples of \u0026lsquo;something meaningful\u0026rsquo; within a single notebook). It could be a visualization of a certain subset of information. It could show how to map the material. It might make the material more easily available. Other things are possible. See the examples in the wild.\n the notebook will combine both the code and observations explaining what is going on, where the data is coming from, how to run the notebook. the jupyter notebook will be kept under version control in Github. see the guidance note for more information    Notebook Reflection. Each student will write a document to accompany the notebook that situates what the notebook does in the broader literature and discussion that we have already examined. It might walk the user through the notebook to suggest further questions a user might want to pose, and why it might matter, or ways the work could be extended.. This will be written as a text file using Markdown conventions, that cites readings and other pertinent materials; it might also link to relevant annotations in our discussions. See the guidance note for more information.\n  Nobody in the field works in isolation. Collaboration, mutual support, engagement, teamwork, etc, will be rewarded.\r Grading I am required by the University to provide a percentage breakdown for the assessment exercises.\n Discussion leading: 20% (graded: satisfactory / meh /unsatisfactory) Collaborative reading: 20% (graded: satisfactory / meh / unsatisfactory ) Jupyter Notebook: 20% Notebook Reflection: 40%  I reserve the right to adjust those percentages to take into account the particular circumstances of the student.\nI anticipate that the four weeks from weeks 5 - 8 might be the most intensive in terms of time commitment. But I could be wrong; it might come at other times or in the context of the other assignments listed above. If you feel like there\u0026rsquo;s just too much happening we can adjust expectations. Do not hesitate to say that there\u0026rsquo;s too much - quote this notification at me! Email me! I am happy to rearrange things if we need to. I\u0026rsquo;m not out to get anyone.\r Important dates:  Choose your own adventure to be completed by the end of week 2 Discussion leader prep to be completed by the end of week 4 Collaborative reading - completed each week weeks 5 - 8 Jupyter Notebook - aim to complete by week 11; submit by end of week 12 Notebook Reflection - due by the end of the exam period (April 27th). But please try to be finished earlier than that. see also the page on the breakdown of dates and time estimates for the digital skills building aspects of the course.

Collaborate. Talk to each other. Ask for help. Share screenshots. Divy up the task.\nExplaining that you had trouble with something, and identifying the source of the trouble, and/or reaching out for help is a sign of strength, not weakness.\nThe indications of time are not prescriptive in the sense that if it takes you longer than this you are somehow not a clever person. Rather, it\u0026rsquo;s an indication of how long I estimate a task might take if everything goes more or less according to plan. But if after 30 minutes you\u0026rsquo;re flummoxed, STOP. Ask for help. Share what\u0026rsquo;s going on, with me or with a peer. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DO THIS ALONE.\r There\u0026rsquo;s more to a task than just running code; I do want you to think and talk about what the process implies in the context of our readings, or other things you\u0026rsquo;ve done. You might encounter problems that slow you down, meaning you might take longer than my estimated time, and that\u0026rsquo;s ok. Sometimes, it might take you far less time, and that\u0026rsquo;s ok too. I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing this for a while; my estimates might be out of whack. Key thing: I don\u0026rsquo;t want to hear that you laboured at something for ages before you reached out for help.\nAgain, you have my explicit permission to quit these tasks when things stop making sense and to ask for help from your peers, friends, family, random strangers, me, anyone. Just record what happened, the kinds of errors, screenshots, or anything else that will help me troubleshoot with you.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t about catching you out: it\u0026rsquo;s about learning how to do this stuff. And having things break or not work is part of that process. I expect there to be hiccups and frustrations: that\u0026rsquo;s part of the plan.\n Getting Started This might be the first time you\u0026rsquo;ve done anything more complicated with your machine than write an essay. Just take your time, and keep note of what\u0026rsquo;s going on.\nI\u0026rsquo;d like everyone to make sure they get through, and understand:\n Week 1: Hypothesis; Github; Discord. 1 hr  In Week 2, I want you to at least explore. If you can go further, do so!\n Week 2: Explore the GLAM Workbench. 1 hr  Go further: see if you can figure out how to run some of the notebooks in the GLAM workbench\nGoing even further: make some changes to those notebooks, and save the changes. 2 hrs\nBasic Skills I\u0026rsquo;d like everyone to make sure they get through, and understand, these two tasks:\n Week 3: The Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks. 30 - 40 minutes Week 3: The Introduction to Python Notebook. 1 hr  If you\u0026rsquo;re feeling good about things: Push yourself, and follow the install and run Jupyter on your own machine instructions; download one of the notebooks and see if you can run it locally. 1 hr. Not a requirement.\nPlease complete, and understand:\n  Week 4: Explore the two notebooks from the National Library of Scotland (1) (2); copy to your own Github; see if you can launch from your own repo using the Binder service. 45 min. If you\u0026rsquo;re feeling good about this: Push yourself, and modify (and save) the code to visualize some other aspect of the data: 45 min.\n  Week 4: Build a pesonal dataset of materials from the Museum of History using the simple scraper notebook. 1.5 hrs. Going further: try to build a new scraper from scratch on a webpage of your choice; this tutorial from Melanie Walsh\u0026rsquo;s class will walk you through that process. 1.5 hrs\n  We take a break from the tech aspect during weeks 5 to 8. However, if you find yourself with time and you are so inclined, I would encourage you to practice what you\u0026rsquo;ve already learned, and see if you can push the examples you\u0026rsquo;ve encountered further. 30 - 45 minutes per week say? You might wish to make a start on the next technical stuff now, if you know that your other courses will be heavy towards the end of term.\r Build On What You\u0026rsquo;ve Learned  Week 9: Complete the notebook on visualizing data (basic plots). 30 mins. Week 9: Write a notebook from scratch that grabs open data from CSTM and then visualize one dimension (column) from the data. 2 hrs.   Week 10: Cleaning Data with R. 2 hrs Week 10: Working with tabular data using Walsh\u0026rsquo;s tutorial. 2 hrs  If you\u0026rsquo;re feeling good about things: Push yourself, and try pushing some of your data online with the datasette. 2 hrs. Not a requirement. Don\u0026rsquo;t put images online; use the links to the image instead.\n Week 11: Make a new notebook that ingests data from a Datasette created by one of your peers, or from another Ottawa source It should also visualize or otherwise work with the data. 2 hrs  If you\u0026rsquo;re feeling good about things: Push yourself, and see if you can visualize the provenance of your data (create a notebook that maps the origins of your data). 2 hrs. Not a requirement. Push yourself further: build a notebook that creatively warps/deforms the data (eg, sonification). 3 hrs. Not a requirement.\nBuild Your Contribution to the Ottawa GLAM Workbench  Week 12: Build your official notebook for submission (code + commentary). It can reuse elements from your earlier experiments, or expand one of your earlier experiments. Write the Notebook Reflection that contextualizes the notebook. Devote all of the time you have this week to this task. 5 hrs  My estimate of the total time on tech tasks (not counting the \u0026lsquo;push yourself\u0026rsquo; materials) over the 12 weeks: 19.25 hrs.\n","description":"Technical tasks listed by week with an estimate of how much time they will take","id":21,"section":"building","tags":null,"title":"The Sequence of Technical Work","uri":"https://dhmuse.netlify.app/building/tech-req-at-a-glance/"},{"content":"A list of interesting / useful notebooks and other things\nBasic Skills We are going to use Jupyter Notebooks in this class.

You are the trailblazer, the guide, the scout, the point of first-contact, with a new and puzzling text. If there are two discussion leaders for a week, divy up the work between you equitably.\nThe seminar discussions all happen through the medium of Hypothes.is annotations: it is critical that you get these prepared in advance of your official \u0026lsquo;week\u0026rsquo; so that Collaborative Readers can respond. Photo by Harli Marten, unsplash.com\nWhile the tips below assume you are writing your annoations, an annotation can also display video or audio. Optionally, you are welcome to use video or audio as well, if you\u0026rsquo;d like; this might work best for the page-level annotations (see below).\nYou can post video to youtube and mark it \u0026lsquo;unlisted\u0026rsquo;; then paste the URL to the video in the annotation. Hypothesis will automatically display the video in the annotation.\nFor audio, you might use something like soundcloud. Other options are available.\nTips for annotating passages in the text   Look for what is puzzling, intriguing, or ambiguous in the text. If you read a passage, and you find yourself pausing because you\u0026rsquo;re not sure what you just read, that\u0026rsquo;s a good sign that here is something that needs unpacking.\n  Try not to annotate whole paragraphs. Keep the focus tight - a sentence or two; sometimes even just a phrase or a single word.\n  Use the toolbar within the Hypothesis annotation interface to emphasize your points. Use italics, bullet points, or bold text to highlight or emphasize as appropriate. Insert links to other relevant texts or annotations (every annotation has its own unique URL or \u0026lsquo;permalink\u0026rsquo;) if that will help to make your point. You can also insert images or youtube videos!\n  Add tags to your annotation to categorize the nature of the annotation or the idea under discussion. As we go through the course, we will see connections emerge between the readings as a result of these tags; when you write your case study, notebook, or exit ticket, being able to see all of the annotations using a particular tag (and then link to them) will deepen all our understanding of the materials.\n  Try to ask open ended questions, or make observations that invite more than \u0026lsquo;yes\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;no\u0026rsquo; responses.\n  Aim for at least 5 good annotations per paper.\n  Use Crowdlaaers or Jon Udell\u0026rsquo;s Facet Viewer to keep track of annotations, so that you can respond in a timely fashion to other\u0026rsquo;s annotations. Crowlaaers.org;Facet Viewer. For both of these, you need to add your API token. (You can find that here, when you\u0026rsquo;re already logged into Hypothesis). Once you copy your token, paste it in Crowdlaaers by clicking on the \u0026lsquo;Groups\u0026rsquo; button; on the facet viewer, scroll to the bottom and paste it in the \u0026lsquo;Hypothesis API token\u0026rsquo; box; then hit refresh on your browser.\n  Tips for annotating the whole document (\u0026lsquo;page\u0026rsquo; annotations) Your whole-page annotation gives a global overview of why this document is important, and what it offers to the rest of us.\n  You can make the annotation in text, or you can record yourself speaking about the document. If you choose the latter, you could make an \u0026lsquo;unlisted\u0026rsquo; youtube video, and then paste the youtube URL into the annotation box. Hypothesis will embed the video directly. You could just record audio if you want; soundcloud.com can host those, and you could then just embed the link.\n  When appropriate, use the THOMAS mnemonic to help you create a succinct overview (by Danna Agmon). In some cases, only parts of the mnemonic will be useful.\n  THOMAS stands for \u0026lsquo;Topic Historiography Organization Method Argument So what\u0026rsquo;\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to address every aspect of the mnemonic in the same depth, and I\u0026rsquo;m not looking for essays here. But essentially, the mnemonic does cover all the bases for an effective summary that you are crafting for the benefit of your peers. Danna Agmon organized this mnemonic so that the questions are arranged in ascending order of importance, from least to most. So if you have to hedge your bets, the \u0026lsquo;so what\u0026rsquo; is the most critical thing I want to see in your full-page annotation.\n Topic: The basic questions: When? Where? What is this [item] about?\nHistoriography: What are the multiple scholarly conversations in which this work participates? What does it add to these conversations?\nOrganization: what is the central organizing structure of this work? Chronological? Thematic? Geographic? Are there any narrative devices put to use? How does the organization advance the argument?\nMethod: What sources are used in this book? How is this evidence analyzed? Is there an overarching theoretical or conceptual approach? How does the theory intersect with the evidence?\nArgument: What is this author’s original thesis? What new thing does it explain?\nSo what?

It would be helpful - but not required - to coordinate with your peers so that we have a wide variety of final notebooks. But even if two people created notebooks working with the same data, you would in all likelihood go about it in different ways, and so a user/reader would still learn from your example.\nThe notebook should do something meaningful with the data, with two examples of \u0026lsquo;something meaningful\u0026rsquo; within a single notebook, from the same data source:\n What constitutes a \u0026lsquo;thing\u0026rsquo;? It could be a visualization of a certain subset of information. It could show how to map the material. It might make the material more easily available. It might do some sort of creative remixing. Other things are possible. See the examples in the wild. What constitutes \u0026lsquo;meaningful\u0026rsquo;? Well, that\u0026rsquo;s an argument you would make in full in your Notebook Reflection. But you\u0026rsquo;d also include a briefer indication within your notebook as well, summarizing what the notebook will do, what data it will work with, and where a user/reader might like to expand or change things or push further.  Requirements  The notebook will have the following subheadings   Introduction ~ This section will introduce your goals for the notebook, and briefly situate what your notebook does and why it matters. Data ~ This section will discuss the source of your data, is strengths / limitations, and will include the necessary code to load the data up. The discussion here may be brief; you will want to address the same questions in more depth in your Notebook Reflection.  It may well be that you are loading data from some other website; it could be that you\u0026rsquo;ve already downloaded, subsetted, and cleaned data from somewhere; in this case, you\u0026rsquo;d be loading the data from your own github repository or Datasette on Heroku.   The body of your notebook will have subheadings as appropriate to the tasks you are doing. Each subheading should also include a text block that explains the overall task being done in the section. Code should be commented thoroughly. Conclusion ~ This section will summarize what the reader/user has just accomplished, pointing out those points/places where they might wish to expand or modify to work with their own data. References ~ Citations \u0026amp; links to anything you drew upon to build the notebook. Further Readings ~ links to three resources that will help your reader take your example further or think about it more deeply.   Text blocks should be written using Markdown conventions. Here\u0026rsquo;s a cheatsheet.\n  A copy of your notebook should be kept in a Github repo. This repo may be public or private. If it is private, share it with user shawn.graham.\n  Other Considerations  You should probably be writing the notebook on your own machine, having already installed python and jupyter notebooks locally. You would then lodge copies of your notebook in a repo on Github you\u0026rsquo;ve created for the task, as you go. These copies can then be launched using Binder for live engagement.   Alternatively, you can launch this demo from Binder which is preloaded with Python and R. It might take a few minutes to launch. You can create a new notebook by hitting \u0026lsquo;new\u0026rsquo; then under \u0026lsquo;notebook\u0026rsquo; select python 3:  Download your work TO YOUR OWN MACHINE if you are using an online binder. The Binder service can time-out after a certain amount of inactivity. If you just hit \u0026lsquo;save\u0026rsquo;, it\u0026rsquo;s only saving on the temporary image at Binder and will be deleted. Hit save, then download from the file menu.  Another alternative: if you have a google account, you can use the Google colab service to create your notebooks. These can be saved directly to your own gdrive or to your github account, as well as locally. Again, this service will time-out so it is important to save your work frequently to your own machine or gdrive. An advantage of using Colab is that it will give you access to a GPU, which is handy if you are doing anything computationally heavy, like image recognition.  You may wish to collaborate with one of your peers.   This collaboration could take the form of co-authoring the notebook and the notebook reflection; in this case, you will also be required to discuss the nature of your collaboration, who did what and why and was this equitable, how you managed conflict, how you organized your time, and what lessons your collaboration might imply for GLAM organizations. Alternatively, you could coordinate your notebooks to work with the same data source to highlight different but complementary aspects. You would then work out an ideal sequence for how the user/reader might engage with the materials. What perspective emerges on the data by using your notebooks? I\u0026rsquo;m open to other ideas; talk to me.  Even if you\u0026rsquo;re not formally collaborating with anyone, talk about what\u0026rsquo;s working, what isn\u0026rsquo;t, and what troubles you\u0026rsquo;ve run into in our Discord space.

If you spot someone asking for help and you can offer advice, respond to the annotation.\nRead completely through before trying to set things up.\n Introduction Github is a code sharing website often used by digital historians. \u0026lsquo;Git\u0026rsquo; is a program that takes snapshots of the current state of a folder, and stores them in sequence, allowing you to revert your changes to an earlier state. It also allows you to create branches, or duplicates of your folder, so you can experiment. If you like the results of your work, you can merge that branch back into your original.\nGithub therefore is a hub for sharing these git snapshots.\nA branch (a copy, a duplicate) of your work uploaded to Github could therefore be copied to say my account (a fork); then I might download to my machine to work on it (I\u0026rsquo;ve pulled it). Once I\u0026rsquo;m happy with my changes, I commit them (save them to the sequence of changes that Git tracks), and then I could push those changes to the fork in my account. I would then send you a pull request or notification, asking you to pull my changes back to your account; you could then decide whether or not to merge.\nFor our purposes, you will use Github mostly as a place to put your reflections or other pieces of work; when we combine Github repos with other things, like Binder, we have the foundation for our own digital infrastructure. I might sometimes fork your work, pull it down onto my machine, make changes that I commit, push it back online, and ask you to pull the changes back. But that won\u0026rsquo;t happen very often. It takes a while to get comfortable with this. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of useful code, in the cultural heritage informatics space, that gets shared on Github. Knowing the basics enables you to enter this world.\nGet your account  Got to github.com and sign up for an account. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to use your real name. (Protip: You might want to set up an email just for signing up for things.)  Verify your account.  Select the free tier (nb: I will never require you to pay for any reading, or any software. If something wants you to pay, stop and ask for help).  Skip telling Github anything about yourself.  Do the verification email thing. Once you hit the verification link in your email, you\u0026rsquo;ll be brought back to Github to make a new repository:  Give it a reasonable name; below I just called it week-one. Tick the \u0026lsquo;initialize with a readme\u0026rsquo; box, tick off the \u0026lsquo;private\u0026rsquo; box, and hit the green commit button. (Nb It\u0026rsquo;s your choice to choose public OR private):  And on the final page, hit the \u0026lsquo;dismiss\u0026rsquo; button in the \u0026lsquo;Github Actions box\u0026rsquo;  Ta Da! You now have a github account, and you\u0026rsquo;ve created your first repository. Going Forward you can create a new repository for any week\u0026rsquo;s work, for a distinct project, and so on. You can create a new repository from the plus sign in the top right corner:\nnb Remember to tick off the \u0026lsquo;initialize with a readme.md\u0026rsquo; file.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve done that, you\u0026rsquo;ll be at your Github user page:\nAdd me as a collaborator to this and any subsequent private repositories you create for this course:   Private Repo: Then, once you\u0026rsquo;ve clicked on \u0026lsquo;manage access\u0026rsquo;, click on \u0026lsquo;invite collaborator\u0026rsquo;,\n  Private Repo: Then find my username shawngraham, and add me:\n  Setting up a \u0026lsquo;repository\u0026rsquo; for your work A \u0026lsquo;repository\u0026rsquo; is just a folder that you\u0026rsquo;ve shared on Github. There are two ways to do this; the easy way and the more complex way. Luck you, you have already done the easy way - you selected the initialize with a readme, and it\u0026rsquo;s already present in your browser!\nTo create new repositories, just click on the + button on the top right of your Github page when you\u0026rsquo;re logged in. Remember to tick off the initialize with a readme box. Think about whether you want them private or public. But if you didn\u0026rsquo;t tick the initialize box, you\u0026rsquo;ve embarked on the more complex way. In the screenshot below, I created a new repository but I forgot to initialize it, and now I\u0026rsquo;m looking at this page:\nIf this is you, do not despair.\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;ve forgotten to initialize a new repo: You\u0026rsquo;re going to have to install one or two things, and do some work at the command prompt or terminal.\n If you have a PC, click on this link to download and install git. Just use all of the suggested default settings when you run the installer. If you have a Mac, you can install it by opening the terminal program (click on your applications and type \u0026lsquo;terminal\u0026rsquo; in the search window) and then typing in these two commands (or copy and paste). The first command starts at the / and ends at the \u0026quot; and you must include the entire line from slash to closing quotation mark:  /bin/bash -c \u0026quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)\u0026quot; and when that finishes,\nbrew install git Make a new directory on your computer with the same name as the repo you created above. For my screenshotted example above, that would be week-two. On a PC, find the folder in your file explorer; click on it so that\u0026rsquo;s the folder displayed in the address bar at the top of the explorer. Then, click in the address bar and type cmd and hit enter. This will open a command prompt window for that folder, allowing you to type commands in directly. On a Mac, go to System Preferences, select Keyboard \u0026gt; Shortcuts \u0026gt; Services. Look for \u0026lsquo;New Terminal at Folder\u0026rsquo; and tick the box. Open your finder; find the folder you created, right-click and select \u0026lsquo;open Terminal here\u0026rsquo;.  A Quick Primer for Working at the Command Line or Terminal\nThe following two videos, one for PC, one for Mac, show you how to do this. For reference\u0026rsquo;s sake, this is what \u0026lsquo;working at the command prompt\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;working at the terminal\u0026rsquo; look like on your machine. When you interact with your computer, you can do it through a graphical interface - icons, clicks, etc - or you can directly type in commands. It\u0026rsquo;s this latter kind of interaction that most people think of as \u0026lsquo;coding\u0026rsquo;, but for us, this is just \u0026lsquo;opening the hood\u0026rsquo;.\n PC:\n  Mac:\n  Key commands for PC:\n dir show the contents of the current directory cls clear the window so that it\u0026rsquo;s fresh again cd directory-name change director to the named directory cd .. change directory up one level if you hit the up or down arrows you can cycle through the history of commands you\u0026rsquo;ve already typed  Key commands for Mac:\n ls list the contents of the current directory pwd print the path (location) of the current directory cd directory-name change director to the named directory cd .. change directory up one level history prints out the entire history of commands you\u0026rsquo;ve typed this session up and down arrows will cycle through this list  Do you see where, in your browser at github, it says ...or create a new repository on the command line? With your command prompt or terminal open in the appropriate folder on your machine (remember, folders on your machine = repos on github), type in each line exactly as it is there (beginning with echo), hitting enter at the end of each line, in order. If the command works, you\u0026rsquo;ll just be presented with the next prompt. The computer only ever responds when there is output to print - which often means only when there is an error message to report. (nb Git might prompt you to enter your email and name, as it does in the PC video, the first time you ever do this).  Ta da! You can now go to github.com\\\u0026lt;your-user-name\u0026gt;\\your-repo and you\u0026rsquo;ll see it all there tickety boo.\nMaking a new text file on Github You can make a new text file by clicking on the \u0026lsquo;create new file\u0026rsquo; button; remember to always use .md as the file extension. You can specify headers, links, images, bullets, blockquotes and so on by using markdown conventions\nThe two videos below might be a bit clearer on youtube itself.\n  Uploading a file into Github You can add new files from your computer by dragging and dropping them into the main repository. At the end of this video, I show you how to display the image in the text of the reflection.\n  ","description":"Github nuts and bolts","id":27,"section":"building","tags":null,"title":"Guidance for Github","uri":"https://dhmuse.netlify.app/building/github-guidance/"},{"content":"Goal The goal here is to create a kind of guide to a selected notebook that shows what the notebook can do. It walks the user through the notebook, how to use it, perhaps visualize results or ways to extend it, in order to suggest questions a user might want to pose, and why it might matter. That last point is the most \u0026lsquo;case study\u0026rsquo;-ish bit.

Be succinct.  Illustrate. Create screenshots \u0026amp; illustrate these with arrows, circles, etc to make it clear what\u0026rsquo;s going on. On a Mac, you can use cmd+4 to take a screenshot, and then the preview app to annotate it. On a PC, the snip-it tool can be used the same way. Change the names of the files to your-surname-fig-1.png (or .jpg, as appropriate) and so on, so that I don\u0026rsquo;t lose track of things. Insert images into your document with markdown: ![alt-descriptive-text](your-surname-fig-1.png).  Video walkthroughs can be helpful too. I use the free version of https://screencast-o-matic.com/ . The resulting file can be saved on your computer and then placed in your repository; it can also be uploaded to your userspace on screencast-o-matic and then can be embedded from there. If you load it to your own repo, just flag where the video should go, e.g., ~insert video 1 here~ and I\u0026rsquo;ll do the rest when I compile everything. Otherwise, use the embed code from screencast-o-matic. Mac users can also make quick videos using cmd+5; Windows 10 users can use the x-box app screenrecorder (press Windows+G) (more info for Windows).

I recommend using Anaconda to manage all of your python related work. Get Anaconda here and get the 3.7 version. In the instructions below, you will also be installing Homebrew if you are on a Mac. Both PC and Windows people will need to install the command line interface (CLI) for Heroku. I recommend Mac people install Homebrew so that they can download the CLI from their terminal (also, lots of useful software is distributed using Homebrew). Windows people don\u0026rsquo;t need Homebrew; they can install the CLI installer for Windows from the Heroku page.  What is Heroku? Heroku is a platform for delivering web apps. For our purposes, it\u0026rsquo;s free. The 0.50$ tour - a simple server just delivers basic static webpages to the web. If you want some kind of interactivity, or you\u0026rsquo;re doing complex database driven queries and functions, you need a server with a lot more power. Heroku does that. In my guidance on using Datasette with Glitch you learned that Glitch can host very small datasets using Glitch\u0026rsquo;s collaborative coding environment. This is great for when you want to quickly test something out, or share very small data, but it\u0026rsquo;s not a good solution if you want to put larger materials online. We\u0026rsquo;ll use Heroku for that.\nHere we go! 1. Create a python environment for your work Open a new terminal (Mac) or start up Conda and start a new terminal window (Windows). (Windows users, look for \u0026lsquo;command prompt for powershell anaconda\u0026rsquo; and start that.) I make a version of python - an \u0026lsquo;environment\u0026rsquo; - just for working with this course by using the command $ conda create, like so:\n$ conda create --name dhmuse\nand pressing y for \u0026lsquo;yes, i do want to create a pythion environment called \u0026lsquo;dhmuse\u0026rsquo;'. There are many different packages or bundles of python-legos out there that can be combined to do lots of different things. You create environments to manage all of these pieces so that you don\u0026rsquo;t create conflicts. I create an environment for analytical work, or for creative work, or for database work, or for a unique project, so that my different pieces of code have just the right pieces they need. Then, I can remind myself what conda environments I have by entering:\n$ conda env list\nand can then select the one I want by typing it in after the \u0026lsquo;activate\u0026rsquo; command:\n$ conda activate dhmuse\nWhen I\u0026rsquo;m finished, I can type\n$ conda deactivate\nand I\u0026rsquo;m done. Remember! The convention when writing about code is to provide the command prompt $ or \u0026gt; but you do not enter that prompt yourself!\n2. Install datasette and csvs-to-sqlite At the $ prompt in your new environment which has been activated (you\u0026rsquo;ll see the name of your environment now appearing in your command line), you\u0026rsquo;ll install a utility that converts csvs to sqlite format; that is, from a plain table to a table formatted for use with sql powered databases:\n$ pip install csvs-to-sqlite\nThen\n$ pip install datasette\nbecause we are installing inside the environment we just created these particular commands (packages; boxes of code legos) will not be available after you type conda deactivate. They live inside this environment only.\n More info about CSVS-toSQLITE https://github.com/simonw/csvs-to-sqlite More info about Datasette https://datasette.readthedocs.io  3. Convert your table of data to a database Now we convert your csv table of data to a sql database:\n$ csvs-to-sqlite your-data-table.csv your-database.db\nWhen it finishes running, check it out via datasette:\n$ datasette your-datasette.db\nTa da! Your data is running probably at http://127.0.0.1:8001. Check it out! Hit ctrl+c in your terminal to stop it.\n4. Publish to the web; install Heroku command line tools Now we\u0026rsquo;re going to publish to the web, putting it on space at heroku\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re on a Mac, get homebrew to install heroku by running these command:\n$ /usr/bin/ruby -e \u0026quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\u0026quot;\n$ brew tap heroku/brew \u0026amp;\u0026amp; brew install heroku\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re on Windows, download and run the installer.\n5. Get an account at Heroku Now, go to Heroku.com and make an account. Keep note of your username and your password, you\u0026rsquo;ll need them.\n6. Login to Heroku at the command line Back in the terminal/command line, now that Heroku is installed, tell it you want to login to your account:\n$ heroku login -i\nIt\u0026rsquo;ll ask you for your username and password; enter them.\nDrumroll please!\n7. Publish to the web Now we publish your database file to the web:\n$ datasette publish heroku --name cstm-demo cstm.db\nwhere the --name flag is the subdomain you want your data to be available at. In my case, my choice of \u0026lsquo;cstm-demo\u0026rsquo; becomes available at http://cstm-demo.herokuapp.com\nReference The publish-to-heroku command has many options:\n$ datasette publish heroku --help\nUsage: datasette publish heroku [OPTIONS] [FILES]... Options: -m, --metadata FILENAME Path to JSON file containing metadata to publish --extra-options TEXT Extra options to pass to datasette serve --branch TEXT Install datasette from a GitHub branch e.g. master --template-dir DIRECTORY Path to directory containing custom templates --plugins-dir DIRECTORY Path to directory containing custom plugins --static MOUNT:DIRECTORY Serve static files from this directory at /MOUNT/... --install TEXT Additional packages (e.g. plugins) to install --plugin-secret \u0026lt;TEXT TEXT TEXT\u0026gt;...

Of course, if you\u0026rsquo;re confident in your technical abilities or just looking for a refresher, then this written guide to the command line is for you!\nStep 1: Accessing the Command Line To navigate the command line in macOS, we use Terminal, which is a built-in application. Terminal is located in the Utilities folder under Applications, and icon for it looks like a black box with an arrow in the upper left corner. With that being said, the actual easiest way to open up Terminal is by searching for it in spotlight\u0026ndash; hit enter once it pops up and there you go! The command line!\nDisclaimer: Your command line will probably look different to mine\u0026ndash; because I use it so often I\u0026rsquo;ve customized it a bit to make it easier to use for myself\u0026ndash; BUT you should still have something that looks like this and reads something like:\nhomebase@Chantals-MacBook-Pro ~ % Except, obviously, the device name will be yours and not mine (I hope\u0026hellip;).\nSo, now that we have Terminal open, we can ask, what is this? Well, what it is is in the name! The command line is a text interface for your computer aka your whole computer and everything it does in text form\nThis means that with the command line, instead of clicking to tell it what to do, you type that command instead! In this class, we\u0026rsquo;ll being mostly using the command line to navigate file directories and run code and software.\nA good way to make all of that less confusing is to just start with showing you some basic commands, and we\u0026rsquo;ll start with the simplest task: navigating directories!\nStep 2: Navigating Directories So a \u0026ldquo;directory\u0026rdquo; is essentially a folder on your computer. In Terminal, before the percent, you should see a tilde (the squiggly line), and this tells you that you\u0026rsquo;re in your home directory! This is where you\u0026rsquo;ll start each time you open a new Terminal session.\nIn Finder, it corresponds to the sidebar folder with a house next to it:\nThis is basically the Ultimate Folder that has all of the user\u0026rsquo;s aka your \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; files, and from here you can go anywhere else on your computer.\nFor example, let\u0026rsquo;s say I want to go to the folder I have on my desktop, HIST3000. First, I\u0026rsquo;m going to type cd which stands for \u0026ldquo;change directory\u0026rdquo;.\nThe next part after cd is like you\u0026rsquo;re thinking about where you want to go, then typing it out! So first I need to get to my desktop, and then I want to be in my folder for HIST3000. My entire command looks like this:\ncd Desktop/HIST3000 and if I hit enter:\nAs you can see, as indicated by HIST3000 being before the percent instead of the tilde, I\u0026rsquo;m now in the HIST3000 folder! If I want to go even further into the folder, I can cd once again:\nAs you\u0026rsquo;ve probably extrapolated by this point, part before the percent tells you the folder you\u0026rsquo;re in, but you can also verify where you are by typing pwd which stands for \u0026ldquo;print working directory\u0026rdquo;\u0026ndash; the directory you navigated to and are working \u0026ldquo;in\u0026rdquo;:\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s say you\u0026rsquo;ve gone TOO far into a directory, and now you want to go back. I\u0026rsquo;m just going to back up to my home directory real quick to demonstrate how to do this.\nYou can go back one directory by typing ... If I type that once, I\u0026rsquo;m 2 directories away from the home directory, I\u0026rsquo;m going to enter cd ../.. to go alll the way back like so:\nOkay, going back to my HIST3000 folder by accessing my previous commands through hitting \u0026ldquo;up\u0026rdquo; on my arrow keys, if you ever want to see what\u0026rsquo;s actually in your directory via the command line, you can type ls\u0026ndash; list!\nAs you can see, the contents printed to the command line and the contents in my HIST3000 folder are identical.\nFor the next step, we\u0026rsquo;re just going to clean things up by typing clear. This gets rid of all previous commands and output, but don\u0026rsquo;t worry, if you scroll up you can still see your past work from this Terminal session.\nStep 3: Homebrew Okay so as macOS users, we\u0026rsquo;re lucky in the sense that we have a good package manager called Homebrew that can be used in the command line, and this makes a lot of the software that we need for this course very easy and quick to install!\nA package manager is essentially a software that installs software\u0026ndash; to relate this to something you definitely know about, a package manager is like the App Store without a GUI (GUI stands for Graphical User Interface)! It has numerous apps in it, and lets you install the ones you want with a command instead of a click.\nTo install homebrew, all you have to do is paste this command into Terminal and hit enter:\n/bin/bash -c \u0026quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\u0026quot; This may take a while to install\u0026ndash; to verify it\u0026rsquo;s installed, just type brew and see if gives you a list of possbile commands like so:\nI WILL show you quickly how to install something using brew just so you know what a finshed install state looks like, and if you follow along with this part then you\u0026rsquo;ll have a fun way to mess with your friends!\nTo install via brew, the command will start with brew, summoning the package manager.\nIF you are installing something that has a GUI then the next word would be cask but we aren\u0026rsquo;t doing that right now so no need to add it.\nThe next thing you type is install, indicating the action you want to perform using homebrew, and finally the name of what you want to install, which in this case is no-more-secrets. The full command should look like:\nbrew install no-more-secrets Hit enter and run that, then once it\u0026rsquo;s installed you should see this:\nThis paticular program just lists all of the files of the folder you\u0026rsquo;re in by scrambling the names and slowly unscrambling them to make it look like stereotypical hollywood hacking.\nYou need to run ls | nms, where ls means the same as what we learned before, and the line is a \u0026ldquo;pipe\u0026rdquo; indicating the specific thing you want to run ls through, which for us is nms aka no-more-secrets. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, you can uninstall this just as easily as installing by entering brew uninstall no-more-secrets.\nStep 4: Manuals Lastly, if you ever need help using a tool you installed via the command line, you can easily access a manual on it within Terminal!\nFor example, git, a version control system we\u0026rsquo;ll be using in this course has a manual that can be accessed by entering man git, \u0026ldquo;man\u0026rdquo; telling the computer you want a manual, and the word following it indicating what you want a manual for. As soon as you hit enter, this should appear:\nIf you look at the highlighted text, you\u0026rsquo;ll notice that this manual refers to further nested manuals that include more detail, and you can access these by exiting this manual by typing q (for quit) then going to that specific seciton by typing man and section name.

Of course, if you\u0026rsquo;re confident in your technical abilities or just looking for a refresher, then this written guide to the command line is for you!\nStep 1: Accessing the Command Line So first thing we\u0026rsquo;re going to want to do is actually open the command line so you can see what it is.\nTo navigate the command line in Windows, you have 2 options:\n  You can use the pre-installed Windows Powershell that you can find by serching \u0026ldquo;powershell\u0026rdquo; OR\n  You can download the shiny new Windows Terminal from the Microsoft store\u0026ndash; it was release just last year and as you can see:\n  They basically look the same by default. BUT Windows Terminal has nice features that you\u0026rsquo;d find on other modern operating systems like tabbing and the ability to customize the theme that can make working with it a smoother experience, SO I\u0026rsquo;ll be using this for the tutorial.\nWith all that being said, you\u0026rsquo;re probably looking at your screen now like \u0026ldquo;okay but what IS this?\u0026rdquo; Well, it\u0026rsquo;s in the name! The command line is a text interface for your computer, meaning its like your whole computer and everything it does, typed out!\nWhen using the command line, instead of clicking to tell your computer what to do, you type what you want to do as a command instead! In this class, we\u0026rsquo;ll being mostly using the command line to navigate file directories and run code and software.\nA good way to make all of that less confusing is to just start with showing you some basic commands, so we\u0026rsquo;ll start with the simplest task: navigating directories!\nStep 2: Navigating Directories A \u0026ldquo;directory\u0026rdquo; is essentially a folder on your computer. In the terminal, before the arrow, you\u0026rsquo;ll see something like\nC:/Users/[your-user-name] That indicates that you\u0026rsquo;re in your home directory which is good, because it\u0026rsquo;s always where you want to start from! In the File explorer it corresponds to here (This PC):\nThis is basically the Ultimate Folder that has all of the user\u0026rsquo;s aka your \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; folders, which means from here you can go anywhere else on your computer.\nSo, let\u0026rsquo;s say I want to go over a folder called Classes on my Desktop. First, I\u0026rsquo;m going to type cd which stands for \u0026ldquo;change directory\u0026rdquo;.\nThe next part is sort of just like, you\u0026rsquo;re thinking about where you want to go, then typing it out! So first I need to get to my desktop, and then I want to be in my folder for Classes. The full command will look like:\ncd Desktop/Classes Now when I hit enter, the file path before the arrow has changed which lets me know I\u0026rsquo;m in the Classes folder:\nWindows is nice for navigating directories, because if you ever need to go to a specific folder but are unsure of the path, open the folder up in File Explorer, highlight the contents of the address bar, and right-click to copy:\nThen go back to the command line, type cd, and paste!\nNow, lets say you want to see what\u0026rsquo;s actually in your directory. In File Explorer, you just click the folder to see a list of files. In the command line, to display the content of the folder (aka the directory) you\u0026rsquo;re in, you type ls\u0026ndash; list! This is especially useful for occasions when you forget the EXACT name of the directory you need to go to, because you can just get to a point that you DO know, like where we are now, and then look at the list and \u0026ldquo;ah yes, that\u0026rsquo;s the code for that course\u0026rdquo; then cd HIST4101:\nOkay so now we\u0026rsquo;re just going to clean things up by typing clear.\nAs the command suggests, this clears all of your previous work from the command line. You are ready to start anew! Though, do note that this does not reset the terminal, so you\u0026rsquo;ll still be in the directory you were last in:\nIf you want to go \u0026ldquo;back\u0026rdquo; one directory, you can type cd .. which takes you back to Classes. If you want to go all the way back to the home directory, you can do that multiple times in a row:\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re worried about forgetting a command you used earlier, don\u0026rsquo;t let that be a reason not to clean up your workspace! You can just use the up and down arrow keys to scroll through a list of the commands you\u0026rsquo;ve previously entered!\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re hesitant about clearing because you think you might need to reference output from earlier earlier work, like error messages or ls results, in the Windows Terminal specifically you can just open a new tab! Though opening a new tab IS opening a new terminal, so if you want to keep working in the same directory you\u0026rsquo;re going to have to cd into it again.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s all! Now you know how to use the command line well enough to succeed in this class!\nStep 3: Additional Practice and Resources To help you get more familiar with Powershell, firstly, here\u0026rsquo;s a cheatsheet that details the numerous other things you can do from the command line.\nSecondly, here are some links to guides about customizing the appearance of Windows Terminal that I encourage you to check out:\n Colour Themes Make your Terminal easier to read with Oh-My-Posh  ","description":"A guide to getting started with the command line in Windows.","id":36,"section":"building","tags":null,"title":"Using the Command Line on Windows","uri":"https://dhmuse.netlify.app/building/command-line-win/"},{"content":"Working with R R is a programming language designed for statistical computing and graphics creation, so it is excellent when it comes to analyzing large sets of data and creating visualisations from it\u0026ndash; which tends to be a big part of our work in digital humanities! The language was designed by and for statisticians and data analysts, thus many of those with little or no experience with programming find R a bit easier to understand and use than other programming languages. In this class, you can choose to use Python, R, or both! It\u0026rsquo;s just a matter of figuring out what works best for you.\nInstall R R can be installed like any other software you\u0026rsquo;d install on your computer. Follow this link to go to the CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) home page, then choose your OS to be taken to the appropriate R download for your machine.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re on macOS, you can also use Homebrew to install R\u0026ndash; just run:\nbrew install r Installing \u0026amp; Using RStudio We CAN use R from the R Console which was likely installed alongside R on your machine, but most people prefer to use RStudio, which can be downloaded here (we want the desktop version). RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R, which means it lets you do everything you can with R all from one place on your computer!\nWorking in RStudio So you have everything installed, you launch RStudio on your computer, and you see this:\nKind of intimidating, maybe, so let\u0026rsquo;s take a more detailed look at all the parts you\u0026rsquo;ll need to know. To write a program in R, you need to create a new R Project, which can be done by:\n Going to the upper right corner of RStudio where it says Project: (None) Selecting \u0026ldquo;New Project\u0026rdquo;, then:\na. New Directory if you don\u0026rsquo;t already have a folder created with some data you want to analyze in it.\nb. Existing Directory if you already have a folder on your computer you want to work in aka a folder with the data you want to analyze.  You\u0026rsquo;ll then want an R Script\u0026ndash; a place where you can actually write code! This can be done by selecting File from the top menu bar, then going down to New File and finally selecting the R Script option.\nNow that you\u0026rsquo;ve done that and you (should) have an extra pane, shall we go on a little tour?\nIt might still seem a bit confusing, and that\u0026rsquo;s okay, because this is all brand new for you! My challenge to you is to first get yourself a bit more familiar with R as a language by following along with this notebook.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve done that:\n Download the data from that tutorial\u0026rsquo;s repository and place it in a new folder on your computer. In RStudio, create a new project using the Existing Directory option, setting the working directory as the folder you just created. In a new R script, re-do the tutorial but this time just use the notebook as a guide and do each step in RStudio instead!
