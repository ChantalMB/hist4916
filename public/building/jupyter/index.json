One year, when I was in elementary school, I got selected to go to Ottawa to hear Marc Garneau speak at the Science and Technology Museum - he had just returned from his first mission on the space shuttle. It was very exciting. After the talk, I got separated from the rest of the group. I was completely lost, completely overwhelmed, and utterly bewildered. So much stuff! They found me, apparently, in the gallery devoted to computers.\nSeems like I\u0026rsquo;ve been a nerd for a very, very long time.\n[ music ]\nWelcome to DHMuse! This course is my attempt to understand the landscape of cultural heritage informatics, especially here in Ottawa. I\u0026rsquo;m glad you\u0026rsquo;ve decided to join me in this attempt. How do museums and other organizations in the ‘GLAM’ sector (galleries, libraries, archives, museums) keep track of their collections? To what purpose? What might happen if we release these collections into the wild (via the internet)? If we mash these collections together what might we see, and why might it matter? Where are the dangers - and to whom could it be dangerous?\nNow, my background is not in museums. You might say, it\u0026rsquo;s museum-adjacent. I\u0026rsquo;m an archaeologist by training and there is of course a natural connection there between archaeologists and museum curators.\n[ clip of Indiana Jones; ] It belongs in a museum!\nBut I\u0026rsquo;m also the official digital humanities guy, the official digital historian, the digital archaeologist, in the department. So I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to learn how all of these different fields intersect, especially with material culture, the things of history. That is, I think I\u0026rsquo;m working maybe in \u0026lsquo;cultural heritage informatics\u0026rsquo;. I hadn\u0026rsquo;t even heard the term until oh around six or seven years ago when I saw Ethan Watrall, an archaeologist at Michigan State University, using it to describe a training programme he\u0026rsquo;d developed for his grad students.\nCultural Heritage Informatics. I like it. It seems to me that the intersection of digital history, material cutlure, museums, galleries, libraries and archives might be found within the broader field of ‘cultural heritage informatics’. Cultural heritage materials require careful description and organization to permit effective curation, preservation, management, and research. You may have heard the term ‘bioinformatics’ before; that field defines itself as\n ‘the interdisciplinary field that studies and pursues the effective uses of biomedical data, information, and knowledge for scientific inquiry, problem solving and decision making, motivated by efforts to improve human health.’ (Kulikowski et al 2012)\n …in which case, we could define CHI similarly as an interdisciplinary field studying and pursuing the effective use of cultural heritage data, information, and knowledge for humanistic or scientific inquiry, problem solving, and decision making, motivated by efforts to improve human welfare. I added the emphasis there to make an important point. The decisions we make about information are necessarily ethical decisions. Computers operate by replicating the decisions we make, at enormous speed and scale. The consequences can be unintended and unforeseen, and so we have to begin from an ethical perspective that considers from the outset: who will this harm?\n[ music ]\nBy now, you\u0026rsquo;ve had a chance to look over this course website. The entire course is designed to be asynchronous; I don\u0026rsquo;t know about you, but I could live happily without ever being in another zoom meeting. But just because this is asynchronous, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that we don\u0026rsquo;t have a time table to keep, a schedule to observe.\nEach week, there are things that need to get done, in order for us to achieve our goals. By the end of this course, I want you to have built a digital computational notebook that engages with information from one of the galleries, libraries, archives, or museums in Ottawa. It might do an analysis; it might be a creative re-imagining; it might be something else entirely.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re taking inspiration from the work of Australian digital historian Tim Sherratt, who has built what he calls the GLAM Workbench. We\u0026rsquo;re going to put together a version of this from these notebooks that you will make. Thanks to the Students as Partners Programme, I\u0026rsquo;ve also been supported in building this course by Chantal Brousseau, who is doing her history degree with a computer science minor. She is also your classmate and another resource person who can help troubleshoot the tech side of things.\nI want to make it clear that you do not need to be techy to be successful in this course. I know that everyone comes with different comfort levels. My concern - and how I grade - is that you are open and honest about what has worked and what hasn\u0026rsquo;t, and that you think through the why of that. I can\u0026rsquo;t emphasize enough: in tech work, we learn far more from when things break than from things that work the first time. I want you to break things.\nIt\u0026rsquo;ll be awesome. Trust me.\nThe first third of this course then will consist of a tune-up of your digital skills. You will also select some materials to explore in more detail, plotting your own adventure through the CHI literature. You\u0026rsquo;ll then prepare detailed annotations of this material to share with everyone else.\nThen, in the second third of the course, we will look at those materials, and respond to your annotations: basically, we will have a distributed conversation around this literature.\nThis will then set us up for the final third of the course where, using our digital skills and grounding the work in the literature we\u0026rsquo;ve just explored, you will create the computational notebook. You will also write documentation that situates that notebook, so that someone might understand the value, utility, and possibilities that the notebook allows.\nAll of these I will bundle up at the end of the course and turn into a website, the Ottawa GLAM Workbench.\nCool, eh?\nAfter you\u0026rsquo;ve finished listening to this podcast, read through the syllabus - it\u0026rsquo;s critically important that you do this, since this class is probably very unlike any others you\u0026rsquo;ve taken - join the class discord, say hello. Read and start following the instructions for week 1. Sort out a github account (which can be pseudonymous, as long as you let me know what your pseudonym is!). Get the hypothesis account, annotate anything you don\u0026rsquo;t understand or are nervous about in the syllabus and the instructions. You\u0026rsquo;re gonna do great. When life intervenes - and it will - just let me know that something\u0026rsquo;s going on. I don\u0026rsquo;t need to know the details; I trust you. Let me know, and we\u0026rsquo;ll come up with alternatives for you to be successful. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing we can\u0026rsquo;t roll with, if you\u0026rsquo;re willing to trust me.\nOne last thing - from time to time there will be a course podcast for you to listen to. I have invited a number of professionals to reflect on their work and share that with us, so that you gain perspective from those in the field.\nToday, we\u0026rsquo;ll finish off by hearing from Erica Vanden Bosch , Manager of Information Management Services for Ingenium, the Crown Corporation that runs the Science and Technology Museum, the Aviation Museum, and the Food and Agriculture Museum.\nPart Two: Erica Vanden Bosch Hello, my name is Erica Vanden Bosch and I work for Ingenium, Canada\u0026rsquo;s museums of science and innovation. We\u0026rsquo;re located right here in Ottawa Ontario and we run three national museums: we have Canada Agriculture and Food museum; Canada Aviation and Space Museum; and Canada Science and Technology museum.\nWhat do I do? I\u0026rsquo;m the manager of Information Management Services and if you don\u0026rsquo;t know what information management means don\u0026rsquo;t worry. I will do my best to tell you what I do and I\u0026rsquo;ll try and keep it short and sweet. Basically, I\u0026rsquo;m responsible for the overall management of information and corporate memory at Ingenium. That covers a huge volume and variety of information. There\u0026rsquo;s documentation related to the collection like acquisition proposals, exhibition development plans and programming materials and there\u0026rsquo;s also documentation generated by our internal services such as finance and human resources.\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s a really broad portfolio. But of course, I don\u0026rsquo;t personally handle each piece of information. We have 200 plus employees from curators to conservation, exhibition to programming, facilities to security. Each of these groups creates, receives, and uses information to carry out their work. My job is to try to impose controls over how the corporation manages its information.\nAnd these controls need to respect any and all requirements that we are subject to. These could be identified in legislation, regulations, policies and countless other sources. So we take into account rules like copyright, information privacy, information security, information disposition, and that\u0026rsquo;s just the name a few areas but the list goes on and on.\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s me and that\u0026rsquo;s what I do. The next prompt I\u0026rsquo;m going to address is to describe a moment where the digital aspect changed how I do my job. Well, I actually graduated from Carleton University with my undergrad bachelor of arts in English. I graduated in 2015, so some of you may be able to relate to this if you\u0026rsquo;re a little bit younger- basically when I entered the workforce digital had already made its grand entrance.\nSo I certainly haven\u0026rsquo;t experienced a digital transformation in the same way some of my colleagues have and it\u0026rsquo;s not that they\u0026rsquo;re haven\u0026rsquo;t been changes. I mean technologies are constantly evolving and we\u0026rsquo;re often undertaking projects that involve changes to our tech. But I would say I learned digital-first.\nAnd as I work, I often find myself looking back at legacy paper versions of a process. Sometimes handling the legacy paper documents that were generated. So I do bounce between worlds but I\u0026rsquo;m definitely more of a digital-first. And what\u0026rsquo;s clear to me is that digital has so much potential.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s really inspiring. We can reach so many more people; we can share so much more information and we can give so much more control to our users and we can let them decide how they want to interact and use the materials that we have. I guess I don\u0026rsquo;t want to suggest that digital is an easy solution- there\u0026rsquo;s certainly lots of work to do and there are certainly challenges but we can certainly use digital tools to make cultural heritage more accessible and more inclusive. I think that\u0026rsquo;s kind of my big takeaway - even though it\u0026rsquo;s normal to feel comfortable with the more traditional ways of working, sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s good to push ourselves out of our comfort zones when we know it\u0026rsquo;s for a good cause.\nSpeaking of digital I\u0026rsquo;ll move to the next point: what\u0026rsquo;s the greatest challenge that I\u0026rsquo;m currently facing with the digital aspect of my work? I think I struggle to pinpoint one single challenge; to be honest, there are endless challenges, overlapping challenges, and even contradictory challenges where solving one issue seems to somehow aggravate another one.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;ll just highlight one challenge, and it\u0026rsquo;s the level of tech skills that varies from person to person. And that\u0026rsquo;s both in the workforce with people I work with and it\u0026rsquo;s also with the public that we serve- you know, there are people who are incredibly tech savvy, but there are also people who willingly admit that they\u0026rsquo;re not tech friendly in this slightest even and those groups of people often want completely different things from their tech, you know, tech savvy people want a lot of sophisticated functionality.\nAnd the less tech savvy people just want it to be super simple and of course, you know, that\u0026rsquo;s a binary and it\u0026rsquo;s it\u0026rsquo;s not as simple as that there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of people in between. Either way it\u0026rsquo;s really challenging to have our products, our services, and our solutions accommodate the varying levels of technical skills across these people. So that\u0026rsquo;s I think the single greatest challenge I\u0026rsquo;d say right now and my advice for that because I don\u0026rsquo;t want to just leave a challenge up in the air would be:\nThat from your own perspective the best thing you can do is to just to ensure that you yourself have the highest tech skills you can, so that you can understand the tech.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s really to your advantage to have that technical know-how and the more advanced your tech skills are, it\u0026rsquo;s gonna help you when you\u0026rsquo;re trying to resolve problems with the tech; it\u0026rsquo;s also gonna help you understand what options are feasible when you\u0026rsquo;re developing new solutions, when your working under resource restraints. I think it\u0026rsquo;ll even help when you\u0026rsquo;re trying to develop new ideas. So that\u0026rsquo;s the challenge and how I would suggest trying to work with it.\nNext up: where do I see cultural heritage informatics in the future? To be honest before I can jump ahead to the future there\u0026rsquo;s still so much groundwork left to do a lot of GLAMs still need to do work to make their information accessible and in machine readable formats even just internally and to make sure it\u0026rsquo;s comprehensive and consistent and clean. You know, a lot of us have pockets of content that are available and ready to go but there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of content waiting on the sidelines to be processed and to be prepared. So that would give us a great foundation if we could get that to kind of catch up with us.\nAnd then after that, I hope in the future cultural heritage informatics is more open. And I mean, I understand it can only be \u0026lsquo;open\u0026rsquo; when it\u0026rsquo;s possible and when it\u0026rsquo;s appropriate to release that content, so you know, not not complete openness, but \u0026lsquo;conscious openness\u0026rsquo;, deliberate openness and then I also hope that GLAMs continue to collaborate widely. I hope we continue to engage specific groups and communities, especially those that have been underrepresented and I hope we continue to provide opportunities for greater public engagement. I mean, personally, I love seeing crowdsourcing initiatives where the public can explore and contribute to collections. I love \u0026lsquo;colab\u0026rsquo; which is a Library and Archives Canada feature on their website, so if you haven\u0026rsquo;t already, check that out.\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s where I at least hope that we\u0026rsquo;re going in the future. And last but not least: \u0026lsquo;what advice might I give to a student who is interested in the intersection of museums and cultural heritage informatics?\u0026rsquo;\nI\u0026rsquo;ll give three pieces of advice. Number one: just look for opportunities to gain experience and be really open about what those may be, whether that means applying to a volunteer organization, whether that\u0026rsquo;s applying to join an advisory council, whether that\u0026rsquo;s applying for a part-time job, it\u0026rsquo;s an opportunity to gain knowledge skills and networks that can serve you and your professional development.\nAdvice number two would be to reflect on other skills that you may bring to the table and then think creatively about ways that you can kind of market them. So maybe you have graphic design skills or creative writing skills, maybe you\u0026rsquo;re proficient in another language, my example is I\u0026rsquo;m a pretty good typer which is a really boring skill! But it\u0026rsquo;s actually given me opportunities that I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have had otherwise, where I\u0026rsquo;ve been asked to take notes at conferences or meetings and I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been asked to attend them, except people deliberately asked me because they thought \u0026lsquo;oh, you could take notes that would be great\u0026rsquo; and I got exposure to these meetings really early in my career I guess because of this skill set that I had! So be creative about what skills you bring to the table and how they can help move you along.\nAnd last but not least is just to be flexible and adaptable. Again kind of underscoring this whole idea of just be really open to opportunities, you know, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to have to have your first job in a museum to start working on skills that will serve you in the GLAM arena. Don\u0026rsquo;t discount any opportunities and just make the most of everything that comes your way. So, thank you so much for listening today. Have a great day.\n","description":"","id":12,"section":"transcripts","tags":null,"title":"4916a W21 Episode 1","uri":"https://dhmuse.netlify.app/transcripts/episode1/"},{"content":"Transcript of this week\u0026rsquo;s podcast episode.\nPart One So this week is an important week in the class. This is the week where you get to choose your own DHMuse adventure. And by choose your own adventure. I mean- you know the first time I did this class I had a huge list of readings that I wanted everybody to get through. It was in fact quite overwhelming. Both for the students and for myself. So we\u0026rsquo;re going to do it differently this time.\nThis time I want you to take a look at our library of materials, which you can find on the website, and select three of the possible readings there that seem to intersect with you and your interests from at least two of the different areas.\nAnd then you go to the choose your own DH Muse Adventure website, click on the big plus sign, which will open up a little panel, very much like Tumblr, a little box for you to enter in put your materials in there. And then, We will look at these things and we will arrange them into a schedule that makes thematic sense by consensus.\nAnd we\u0026rsquo;ll do that [consensus] in the discord space, okay? So there\u0026rsquo;ll be a lot of talking a lot of back and forth in there. And then I\u0026rsquo;ll add connections to the different, the different panels. So that we can see it and I\u0026rsquo;ll update the website with the relevant weeks on the course.\nSo that, It all gets settled out. So that\u0026rsquo;s the first task for this week. The second task is I want you to go to Tim Sherratt\u0026rsquo;s Glam workbench and just explore it. See what he has done; get a sense of the possibilities; look at how he has engaged with GLAM materials from Australia and New Zealandm and think about- especially- the kinds of tacit knowledge, the hidden steps, the little gotchas that are required to be made explicit for you in order to get through this stuff.\nOkay, so that\u0026rsquo;s the task for this week.\n","description":"","id":13,"section":"transcripts","tags":null,"title":"4916a W21 Episode 2","uri":"https://dhmuse.netlify.app/transcripts/episode2/"},{"content":"      A clever bit of visual juxtaposition. Yes\u0026hellip;? Anyone\u0026hellip;?\n(Photos by Scott Web https://unsplash.com/photos/ab80p262fFM and Ilya Pavlov https://unsplash.com/photos/OqtafYT5kTw )\nHIST4916a Museums and Digital History How do museums and other organizations in the ‘GLAM’ sector (galleries, libraries, archives, museums) keep track of their collections? To what purpose? What might happen if we release these collections into the wild (via the internet)? If we mash these collections together what might we see, and why might it matter? Where are the dangers - and to whom could it be dangerous?\nWhat is Cultural Heritage Informatics? The intersection of digital history and museums might be found within the broader field of ‘cultural heritage informatics’. Cultural heritage materials require careful description and organization to permit effective curation, preservation, management, and research. You may have heard the term ‘bioinformatics’ before; that field defines itself as\n ‘the interdisciplinary field that studies and pursues the effective uses of biomedical data, information, and knowledge for scientific inquiry, problem solving and decision making, motivated by efforts to improve human health.’ (Kulikowski et al 2012)\n …in which case, we could define CHI similarly as an interdisciplinary field studying and pursuing the effective use of cultural heritage data, information, and knowledge for humanistic or scientific inquiry, problem solving, and decision making, motivated by efforts to improve human welfare. I added the emphasis there to make an important point. The decisions we make about information are necessarily ethical decisions. Computers operate by replicating the decisions we make, at enormous speed and scale. The consequences can be unintended and unforeseen, and so we have to begin from an ethical perspective that considers from the outset: who will this harm?\nYou do not need to be \u0026lsquo;techy\u0026rsquo; to be successful in this course! You just need to be diligent, honest, and open. This course is not as tech heavy as some of my other classes. Nevertheless, you will be exposed to several platforms, techs, and approaches that you may not have experienced before. The key is to be open and willing to talk about when things don\u0026rsquo;t go as expected.\nYou will read, watch, listen to, and discuss the class materials via various online tools including Hypothes.is and Github (Speaking of Hypothes.is, highlight a word on this page and see what happens). We do not use cuLearn in the course. We work on the open web instead. What is challenging for one student will not necessarily be challenging for another, and I expect you to push yourself and pull others along as you go. Thus open and honest reporting of what works and what hasn’t worked, is a meaningful aspect of this course. Again: You don’t need to be techy to succeed, but you do need to be willing to embrace when things go ‘wrong’.\nMy goal here is to teach you to use certain digital techs; to unpack and interrogate those techs you learn to use; and to equip you to use these things in a reflective manner. It\u0026rsquo;s about history and musuems and informatics, but also, looking at informatics from a perspective grounded in history. It\u0026rsquo;s going to be uncomfortable. There will be things we try here that will not work. That\u0026rsquo;s why the assessment for this course is built around the process, not the final product.\nText/Tech To the best of my ability, all materials will either be open access materials on the web or materials made available to us through MacOdrum Library or the University. You will not be required to purchase any set text or software.\nHaving a reasonably up-to-date computer will make life easier for you; if you use a chromebook or a low-powered laptop (eg, less than 8 gb of RAM), this will require us to think creatively about some of the work, but should not present an insurmountable obstacle. A good internet connection will make life easier, but I realize that not everyone is well-served by our tech oligopolies. Please let me know if these situations apply to you so that we can work out a suitable plan of action.\nClass format This class will be delivered online, asynchronously. A Discord server will be used to provide a social context to our work, for help, and for collaboration. Learning materials will be curated on this open course website, and might include a variety of modalities. There will be no required synchronous chats or lectures. There might be optional ones. Students will maintain various materials on the web via Github (your Github account may be anonymous or pseudonymous or made private provided access is shared with me).\nWhy? I\u0026rsquo;ve taught online for a variety of institutions, using a variety of formats and approaches. I like teaching asynchronously because I believe it is a kinder approach to complex topics, especially when there is a second layer of difficulty - basic digital literacy, in this case - which intersects with the content, my learning goals for you, your own personal situations - in ways I cannot always anticipate or know.\nSince I cannot know these things, I do not believe that I should bludgeon you with content; I do not think that \u0026lsquo;rigour\u0026rsquo; is demonstrated by forcing you to join me at set times; I do not believe that face-to-face work is somehow more \u0026lsquo;scholarly\u0026rsquo; than other kinds of work. Right now, with the world the way it is, I want to build a structure that opens possibility space for you to engage with this topic, and with CHI when you encounter it beyond this course, in ways that will push you forward as a scholar and citizen.\nFor this to work well, it requires you to be on the same page as me. There is a lot of flexibility built into this course, but it does require you to try to push yourself out of your comfort zone. The key thing is always to tie what you\u0026rsquo;re doing with what you\u0026rsquo;re reading and what you\u0026rsquo;re thinking. That \u0026lsquo;second layer of difficulty\u0026rsquo; will come with practice. But how it intersects with everything else: that\u0026rsquo;s where the learning happens.\n\u0026hellip;and that is why this course is the way it is. No doubt, things will break, and some things will work better/be more effective than others. We will roll with it.\n","description":"what to tell your friends","id":14,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"1. Course Description","uri":"https://dhmuse.netlify.app/docs/1-coursedescription/"},{"content":"Questions How do institutions in the GLAM sector use digital media to support their missions?\nDo digital techs push us towards particular voices in GLAM materials?\nCan/do digital techs in the service of GLAM harm different communities? And if so, how? And what can we do about it?\nWhere are the new frontiers in CHI and GLAM?\nThis course is an opportunity to explore these questions; I do not know the answers! I\u0026rsquo;m excited to figure these out with you. Why not annotate this section with some of your own questions?\nNb The process of teaching is also a process of collaboration between me and you. Sometimes -and we\u0026rsquo;re expecting this, you and I- things won\u0026rsquo;t work as we expect; tech might break; the world might impinge too much. We will adapt accordingly. Remember: the grade in this course is a function of your process and your evolution, so adapting and thinking through the implications of when things don\u0026rsquo;t go according to plan is, in fact, according to plan. Outcomes  Situate the practice, ethical, and intellectual trajectories of informatics within the cultural heritage field Implement and contribute to a ‘GLAM Workbench’, a series of interactive computational notebooks dealing with data from the Ottawa galleries-libraries-archives-museums sector Investigate open data sources, using the methods/techniques/perspectives of digital history and digital humanities Develop a how-to for the workbench that communicate the results of these investigations as an act of public digital history Given that this is an online course, another outcome will be your ability to conduct such research independently. However, no one operates in a vacuum; digital historians collaborate to troubleshoot or develop technologies, and through open practices to data sharing and reuse, learn to build upon each others’ work in a collaborative fashion.  Real Names Policy You do not need to use your real name or identity on any public-facing work that you do in this course. Nor do you need to explain to me why you wish to use a pseudonym. It is sufficient that you send an email to me with the following message:\n‘I would like to use the following username in all public-facing work: xxxxxxxx’\n…where xxxxx is the name you have selected. No questions asked. For safety’s sake, if you decide to use a pseudonym, do not use one that you have used on any other website or social media platform.\nWhen Life Intervenes There\u0026rsquo;s nothing we can\u0026rsquo;t roll with, in this class. That said, I can\u0026rsquo;t help you if I don\u0026rsquo;t know you need help, a breathing space, some direction. When something comes up, just let me know.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to share the details with me. It is enough for me to know that something has intervened. I trust you.\r When something comes up and this course has to move to the backburner, contact me and we can figure out something else to do, or something else that will help you be successful here. It\u0026rsquo;s our course - we can change things up as we need to.\n","description":"what you'll get out of this course","id":15,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"2.

This document will be integrated into the workbench after the class is finished.\nHeritageJam Last year, when I ran this course, the idea was to use the course as a platform to launch the HeritageJam event, with online and in-person components. The pandemic of course kiboshed that. This year, I still want to run HeritageJam, and I\u0026rsquo;d like to have our Ottawa GlAM Workbench play a central role as a resource for a fully-online event. I have funds to support this, and I hope to be able to hire one or two of you to help develop the Ottawa GLAM Workbench further, and to help put the event on.\nBut we\u0026rsquo;ll see; just mark this as TBD.\n","description":"what we are working towards","id":16,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"3.

The notebook should do something meaningful with the data (at least two examples of \u0026lsquo;something meaningful\u0026rsquo; within a single notebook). It could be a visualization of a certain subset of information. It could show how to map the material. It might make the material more easily available. Other things are possible. See the examples in the wild.\n the notebook will combine both the code and observations explaining what is going on, where the data is coming from, how to run the notebook. the jupyter notebook will be kept under version control in Github. see the guidance note for more information    Notebook Reflection. Each student will write a document to accompany the notebook that situates what the notebook does in the broader literature and discussion that we have already examined. It might walk the user through the notebook to suggest further questions a user might want to pose, and why it might matter, or ways the work could be extended.. This will be written as a text file using Markdown conventions, that cites readings and other pertinent materials; it might also link to relevant annotations in our discussions. See the guidance note for more information.\n  Nobody in the field works in isolation. Collaboration, mutual support, engagement, teamwork, etc, will be rewarded.\r Grading I am required by the University to provide a percentage breakdown for the assessment exercises.\n Discussion leading: 20% (graded: satisfactory / meh /unsatisfactory) Collaborative reading: 20% (graded: satisfactory / meh / unsatisfactory ) Jupyter Notebook: 20% Notebook Reflection: 40%  I reserve the right to adjust those percentages to take into account the particular circumstances of the student.\nImportant dates:  Choose your own adventure to be completed by the end of week 2 Discussion leader prep to be completed by the end of week 4 Collaborative reading - completed each week weeks 5 - 8 Jupyter Notebook - aim to complete by week 11; submit by end of week 12 Notebook Reflection - due by the end of the exam period (April 27th).

There are many such tutorials out there; I encourage you to follow this one from Melanie Walsh\u0026rsquo;s Intro to Cultural Analytics class\nStep 2 Anaconda is a package of different programming languages and utilities for \u0026lsquo;scientific computing\u0026rsquo;. Go to the installation page and find the version that is appropriate for your machine. Download and then run the installer.\nAccept all the defaults until you get to this screen:\nThe \u0026lsquo;PATH\u0026rsquo; variable is like a bin where your computer stores the locations of different programs that you want to access from anywhere on your computer (otherwise, you can only access programs when you\u0026rsquo;re in the right place). Tick the \u0026lsquo;Add Anaconda3 to my PATH environment variable\u0026rsquo; check box. Now you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to run Juypter notebooks from the command line in any folder.\nMake sure to verify that everything installed correctly\nAnd GO! On your computer, search for something called \u0026lsquo;Anaconda Navigator\u0026rsquo;. Launch that, then if you click on \u0026lsquo;Jupyter Notebooks\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;Jupyter Lab\u0026rsquo; - you are now all set up and ready to go!\nAn alternative way to launch jupyter notebooks or jupyter labs is to open the command line in a given folder, then type $ jupyter notebook or $ jupyter lab. Note that you don\u0026rsquo;t type the $ symbol; this is a convention to indicate that what follows is meant to be typed on the command line.\nAt this point, if you come across a file with .ipynb as its extension, you can open it and run it in a Jupyter notebook or lab. Try it now - right-click on this link and save-as to your computer. Then, open a command line in the folder where you saved the file. Start up $ jupyter notebook - which opens a new tab in your browser - and then click on the file you downloaded. Now you can run and save your work locally!\n","description":"How to install Jupyter","id":19,"section":"building","tags":null,"title":"Installing Jupyter","uri":"https://dhmuse.netlify.app/building/jupyter/"},{"content":"Photo by Jez Timms, unsplash.com\nThe possible readings are grouped under four broad headings.

Collaborate. Talk to each other. Ask for help. Share screenshots. Divy up the task.\nExplaining that you had trouble with something, and identifying the source of the trouble, and/or reaching out for help is a sign of strength, not weakness.\nThe indications of time are not prescriptive in the sense that if it takes you longer than this you are somehow not a clever person. Rather, it\u0026rsquo;s an indication of how long I estimate a task might take if everything goes more or less according to plan. But if after 30 minutes you\u0026rsquo;re flummoxed, STOP. Ask for help. Share what\u0026rsquo;s going on, with me or with a peer. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DO THIS ALONE.\r There\u0026rsquo;s more to a task than just running code; I do want you to think and talk about what the process implies in the context of our readings, or other things you\u0026rsquo;ve done. You might encounter problems that slow you down, meaning you might take longer than my estimated time, and that\u0026rsquo;s ok. Sometimes, it might take you far less time, and that\u0026rsquo;s ok too. I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing this for a while; my estimates might be out of whack. Key thing: I don\u0026rsquo;t want to hear that you laboured at something for ages before you reached out for help.\nAgain, you have my explicit permission to quit these tasks when things stop making sense and to ask for help from your peers, friends, family, random strangers, me, anyone. Just record what happened, the kinds of errors, screenshots, or anything else that will help me troubleshoot with you.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t about catching you out: it\u0026rsquo;s about learning how to do this stuff. And having things break or not work is part of that process. I expect there to be hiccups and frustrations: that\u0026rsquo;s part of the plan.\n Getting Started This might be the first time you\u0026rsquo;ve done anything more complicated with your machine than write an essay. Just take your time, and keep note of what\u0026rsquo;s going on.\nI\u0026rsquo;d like everyone to make sure they get through, and understand:\n Week 1: Hypothesis; Github; Discord. 1 hr  In Week 2, I want you to at least explore. If you can go further, do so!\n Week 2: Explore the GLAM Workbench. 1 hr  Go further: see if you can figure out how to run some of the notebooks in the GLAM workbench\nGoing even further: make some changes to those notebooks, and save the changes. 2 hrs\nBasic Skills I\u0026rsquo;d like everyone to make sure they get through, and understand, these two tasks:\n Week 3: The Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks. 30 - 40 minutes Week 3: The Introduction to Python Notebook. 1 hr  If you\u0026rsquo;re feeling good about things: Push yourself, and follow the install and run Jupyter on your own machine instructions; download one of the notebooks and see if you can run it locally. 1 hr. Not a requirement.\nPlease complete, and understand:\n  Week 4: Explore the two notebooks from the National Library of Scotland (1) (2); copy to your own Github; see if you can launch from your own repo using the Binder service. 45 min. If you\u0026rsquo;re feeling good about this: Push yourself, and modify (and save) the code to visualize some other aspect of the data: 45 min.\n  Week 4: Build a pesonal dataset of materials from the Museum of History using the simple scraper notebook. 1.5 hrs. Going further: try to build a new scraper from scratch on a webpage of your choice; this tutorial from Melanie Walsh\u0026rsquo;s class will walk you through that process. 1.5 hrs\n  We take a break from the tech aspect during weeks 5 to 8. However, if you find yourself with time and you are so inclined, I would encourage you to practice what you\u0026rsquo;ve already learned, and see if you can push the examples you\u0026rsquo;ve encountered further. 30 - 45 minutes per week say? You might wish to make a start on the next technical stuff now, if you know that your other courses will be heavy towards the end of term.\r Build On What You\u0026rsquo;ve Learned  Week 9: Complete the notebook on visualizing data (basic plots). 30 mins. Week 9: Write a notebook from scratch that grabs open data from CSTM and then visualize one dimension (column) from the data. 2 hrs.   Week 10: Cleaning Data with R. 2 hrs  If you\u0026rsquo;re feeling good about things: Push yourself, and try pushing some of your data online with the datasette. 2 hrs. Not a requirement. Don\u0026rsquo;t put images online; use the links to the image instead.\n Week 11: Make a new notebook that ingests data from a Datasette created by one of your peers, or from another Ottawa source It should also visualize or otherwise work with the data. 2 hrs  If you\u0026rsquo;re feeling good about things: Push yourself, and see if you can visualize the provenance of your data (create a notebook that maps the origins of your data). 2 hrs. Not a requirement. Push yourself further: build a notebook that creatively warps/deforms the data (eg, sonification). 3 hrs. Not a requirement.\nBuild Your Contribution to the Ottawa GLAM Workbench  Week 12: Build your official notebook for submission (code + commentary). It can reuse elements from your earlier experiments, or expand one of your earlier experiments. Write the Notebook Reflection that contextualizes the notebook. Devote all of the time you have this week to this task. 5 hrs  My estimate of the total time on tech tasks (not counting the \u0026lsquo;push yourself\u0026rsquo; materials) over the 12 weeks: 17.25 hrs.\n","description":"Technical tasks listed by week with an estimate of how much time they will take","id":21,"section":"building","tags":null,"title":"The Sequence of Technical Work","uri":"https://dhmuse.netlify.app/building/tech-req-at-a-glance/"},{"content":"A list of interesting / useful notebooks and other things\nBasic Skills We are going to use Jupyter Notebooks in this class.

You are the trailblazer, the guide, the scout, the point of first-contact, with a new and puzzling text. If there are two discussion leaders for a week, divy up the work between you equitably.\nThe seminar discussions all happen through the medium of Hypothes.is annotations: it is critical that you get these prepared in advance of your official \u0026lsquo;week\u0026rsquo; so that Collaborative Readers can respond. Photo by Harli Marten, unsplash.com\nWhile the tips below assume you are writing your annoations, an annotation can also display video or audio. Optionally, you are welcome to use video or audio as well, if you\u0026rsquo;d like; this might work best for the page-level annotations (see below).\nYou can post video to youtube and mark it \u0026lsquo;unlisted\u0026rsquo;; then paste the URL to the video in the annotation. Hypothesis will automatically display the video in the annotation.\nFor audio, you might use something like soundcloud. Other options are available.\nTips for annotating passages in the text   Look for what is puzzling, intriguing, or ambiguous in the text. If you read a passage, and you find yourself pausing because you\u0026rsquo;re not sure what you just read, that\u0026rsquo;s a good sign that here is something that needs unpacking.\n  Try not to annotate whole paragraphs. Keep the focus tight - a sentence or two; sometimes even just a phrase or a single word.\n  Use the toolbar within the Hypothesis annotation interface to emphasize your points. Use italics, bullet points, or bold text to highlight or emphasize as appropriate. Insert links to other relevant texts or annotations (every annotation has its own unique URL or \u0026lsquo;permalink\u0026rsquo;) if that will help to make your point. You can also insert images or youtube videos!\n  Add tags to your annotation to categorize the nature of the annotation or the idea under discussion. As we go through the course, we will see connections emerge between the readings as a result of these tags; when you write your case study, notebook, or exit ticket, being able to see all of the annotations using a particular tag (and then link to them) will deepen all our understanding of the materials.\n  Try to ask open ended questions, or make observations that invite more than \u0026lsquo;yes\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;no\u0026rsquo; responses.\n  Aim for at least 5 good annotations per paper.\n  Use Crowdlaaers or Jon Udell\u0026rsquo;s Facet Viewer to keep track of annotations, so that you can respond in a timely fashion to other\u0026rsquo;s annotations. Crowlaaers.org;Facet Viewer. For both of these, you need to add your API token. (You can find that here, when you\u0026rsquo;re already logged into Hypothesis). Once you copy your token, paste it in Crowdlaaers by clicking on the \u0026lsquo;Groups\u0026rsquo; button; on the facet viewer, scroll to the bottom and paste it in the \u0026lsquo;Hypothesis API token\u0026rsquo; box; then hit refresh on your browser.\n  Tips for annotating the whole document (\u0026lsquo;page\u0026rsquo; annotations) Your whole-page annotation gives a global overview of why this document is important, and what it offers to the rest of us.\n  You can make the annotation in text, or you can record yourself speaking about the document. If you choose the latter, you could make an \u0026lsquo;unlisted\u0026rsquo; youtube video, and then paste the youtube URL into the annotation box. Hypothesis will embed the video directly. You could just record audio if you want; soundcloud.com can host those, and you could then just embed the link.\n  When appropriate, use the THOMAS mnemonic to help you create a succinct overview (by Danna Agmon). In some cases, only parts of the mnemonic will be useful.\n  THOMAS stands for \u0026lsquo;Topic Historiography Organization Method Argument So what\u0026rsquo;\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to address every aspect of the mnemonic in the same depth, and I\u0026rsquo;m not looking for essays here. But essentially, the mnemonic does cover all the bases for an effective summary that you are crafting for the benefit of your peers. Danna Agmon organized this mnemonic so that the questions are arranged in ascending order of importance, from least to most. So if you have to hedge your bets, the \u0026lsquo;so what\u0026rsquo; is the most critical thing I want to see in your full-page annotation.\n Topic: The basic questions: When? Where? What is this [item] about?\nHistoriography: What are the multiple scholarly conversations in which this work participates? What does it add to these conversations?\nOrganization: what is the central organizing structure of this work? Chronological? Thematic? Geographic? Are there any narrative devices put to use? How does the organization advance the argument?\nMethod: What sources are used in this book? How is this evidence analyzed? Is there an overarching theoretical or conceptual approach? How does the theory intersect with the evidence?\nArgument: What is this author’s original thesis? What new thing does it explain?\nSo what? This could be rephrased as “significance” or “stakes.” What is important or useful about this [item], beyond the confines of the topic?

Following Kathleen Fitzpatrick, I understand \u0026lsquo;generous thinking\u0026rsquo; to work like this:\n Generous Thinking [begins] by proposing that rooting the humanities in generosity, and in particular in the practices of thinking with rather than reflexively against [emphasis added] both the people and the materials with which we work, might invite more productive relationships and conversations not just among scholars but between scholars and the surrounding community. - Kathleen Fitzpatrick\n That means I\u0026rsquo;m not looking for annotations that are combative or \u0026lsquo;critical\u0026rsquo; in the sense of oppositional, but rather annotations that invite us to go deeper into the text.

It would be helpful - but not required - to coordinate with your peers so that we have a wide variety of final notebooks. But even if two people created notebooks working with the same data, you would in all likelihood go about it in different ways, and so a user/reader would still learn from your example.\nThe notebook should do something meaningful with the data, with two examples of \u0026lsquo;something meaningful\u0026rsquo; within a single notebook, from the same data source:\n What constitutes a \u0026lsquo;thing\u0026rsquo;? It could be a visualization of a certain subset of information. It could show how to map the material. It might make the material more easily available. It might do some sort of creative remixing. Other things are possible. See the examples in the wild. What constitutes \u0026lsquo;meaningful\u0026rsquo;? Well, that\u0026rsquo;s an argument you would make in full in your Notebook Reflection. But you\u0026rsquo;d also include a briefer indication within your notebook as well, summarizing what the notebook will do, what data it will work with, and where a user/reader might like to expand or change things or push further.  Requirements  The notebook will have the following subheadings   Introduction ~ This section will introduce your goals for the notebook, and briefly situate what your notebook does and why it matters. Data ~ This section will discuss the source of your data, is strengths / limitations, and will include the necessary code to load the data up. The discussion here may be brief; you will want to address the same questions in more depth in your Notebook Reflection.  It may well be that you are loading data from some other website; it could be that you\u0026rsquo;ve already downloaded, subsetted, and cleaned data from somewhere; in this case, you\u0026rsquo;d be loading the data from your own github repository or Datasette on Heroku.   The body of your notebook will have subheadings as appropriate to the tasks you are doing. Each subheading should also include a text block that explains the overall task being done in the section. Code should be commented thoroughly. Conclusion ~ This section will summarize what the reader/user has just accomplished, pointing out those points/places where they might wish to expand or modify to work with their own data. References ~ Citations \u0026amp; links to anything you drew upon to build the notebook. Further Readings ~ links to three resources that will help your reader take your example further or think about it more deeply.   Text blocks should be written using Markdown conventions. Here\u0026rsquo;s a cheatsheet.\n  A copy of your notebook should be kept in a Github repo. This repo may be public or private. If it is private, share it with user shawn.graham.\n  Other Considerations  You should probably be writing the notebook on your own machine, having already installed python and jupyter notebooks locally. You would then lodge copies of your notebook in a repo on Github you\u0026rsquo;ve created for the task, as you go. These copies can then be launched using Binder for live engagement.   Alternatively, you can launch this demo from Binder which is preloaded with Python and R. It might take a few minutes to launch. You can create a new notebook by hitting \u0026lsquo;new\u0026rsquo; then under \u0026lsquo;notebook\u0026rsquo; select python 3:  Download your work TO YOUR OWN MACHINE if you are using an online binder. The Binder service can time-out after a certain amount of inactivity. If you just hit \u0026lsquo;save\u0026rsquo;, it\u0026rsquo;s only saving on the temporary image at Binder and will be deleted. Hit save, then download from the file menu.  Another alternative: if you have a google account, you can use the Google colab service to create your notebooks. These can be saved directly to your own gdrive or to your github account, as well as locally. Again, this service will time-out so it is important to save your work frequently to your own machine or gdrive. An advantage of using Colab is that it will give you access to a GPU, which is handy if you are doing anything computationally heavy, like image recognition.  You may wish to collaborate with one of your peers.   This collaboration could take the form of co-authoring the notebook and the notebook reflection; in this case, you will also be required to discuss the nature of your collaboration, who did what and why and was this equitable, how you managed conflict, how you organized your time, and what lessons your collaboration might imply for GLAM organizations. Alternatively, you could coordinate your notebooks to work with the same data source to highlight different but complementary aspects. You would then work out an ideal sequence for how the user/reader might engage with the materials. What perspective emerges on the data by using your notebooks? I\u0026rsquo;m open to other ideas; talk to me.  Even if you\u0026rsquo;re not formally collaborating with anyone, talk about what\u0026rsquo;s working, what isn\u0026rsquo;t, and what troubles you\u0026rsquo;ve run into in our Discord space. Help each other out. Brainstorm. Share. Kvetch. You are under no obligation to do this work in splendid isolation.

If you spot someone asking for help and you can offer advice, respond to the annotation.\nRead completely through before trying to set things up.\n Introduction Github is a code sharing website often used by digital historians. \u0026lsquo;Git\u0026rsquo; is a program that takes snapshots of the current state of a folder, and stores them in sequence, allowing you to revert your changes to an earlier state. It also allows you to create branches, or duplicates of your folder, so you can experiment. If you like the results of your work, you can merge that branch back into your original.\nGithub therefore is a hub for sharing these git snapshots.\nA branch (a copy, a duplicate) of your work uploaded to Github could therefore be copied to say my account (a fork); then I might download to my machine to work on it (I\u0026rsquo;ve pulled it). Once I\u0026rsquo;m happy with my changes, I commit them (save them to the sequence of changes that Git tracks), and then I could push those changes to the fork in my account. I would then send you a pull request or notification, asking you to pull my changes back to your account; you could then decide whether or not to merge.\nFor our purposes, you will use Github mostly as a place to put your reflections or other pieces of work; when we combine Github repos with other things, like Binder, we have the foundation for our own digital infrastructure. I might sometimes fork your work, pull it down onto my machine, make changes that I commit, push it back online, and ask you to pull the changes back. But that won\u0026rsquo;t happen very often. It takes a while to get comfortable with this. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of useful code, in the cultural heritage informatics space, that gets shared on Github. Knowing the basics enables you to enter this world.\nGet your account  Got to github.com and sign up for an account. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to use your real name. (Protip: You might want to set up an email just for signing up for things.)  Verify your account.  Select the free tier (nb: I will never require you to pay for any reading, or any software. If something wants you to pay, stop and ask for help).  Skip telling Github anything about yourself.  Do the verification email thing. Once you hit the verification link in your email, you\u0026rsquo;ll be brought back to Github to make a new repository:  Give it a reasonable name; below I just called it week-one. Tick the \u0026lsquo;initialize with a readme\u0026rsquo; box, tick off the \u0026lsquo;private\u0026rsquo; box, and hit the green commit button. (Nb It\u0026rsquo;s your choice to choose public OR private):  And on the final page, hit the \u0026lsquo;dismiss\u0026rsquo; button in the \u0026lsquo;Github Actions box\u0026rsquo;  Ta Da! You now have a github account, and you\u0026rsquo;ve created your first repository. Going Forward you can create a new repository for any week\u0026rsquo;s work, for a distinct project, and so on. You can create a new repository from the plus sign in the top right corner:\nnb Remember to tick off the \u0026lsquo;initialize with a readme.md\u0026rsquo; file.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve done that, you\u0026rsquo;ll be at your Github user page:\nAdd me as a collaborator to this and any subsequent private repositories you create for this course:   Private Repo: Then, once you\u0026rsquo;ve clicked on \u0026lsquo;manage access\u0026rsquo;, click on \u0026lsquo;invite collaborator\u0026rsquo;,\n  Private Repo: Then find my username shawngraham, and add me:\n  Setting up a \u0026lsquo;repository\u0026rsquo; for your work A \u0026lsquo;repository\u0026rsquo; is just a folder that you\u0026rsquo;ve shared on Github. There are two ways to do this; the easy way and the more complex way. Luck you, you have already done the easy way - you selected the initialize with a readme, and it\u0026rsquo;s already present in your browser!\nTo create new repositories, just click on the + button on the top right of your Github page when you\u0026rsquo;re logged in. Remember to tick off the initialize with a readme box. Think about whether you want them private or public. But if you didn\u0026rsquo;t tick the initialize box, you\u0026rsquo;ve embarked on the more complex way. In the screenshot below, I created a new repository but I forgot to initialize it, and now I\u0026rsquo;m looking at this page:\nIf this is you, do not despair.\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;ve forgotten to initialize a new repo: You\u0026rsquo;re going to have to install one or two things, and do some work at the command prompt or terminal.\n If you have a PC, click on this link to download and install git. Just use all of the suggested default settings when you run the installer. If you have a Mac, you can install it by opening the terminal program (click on your applications and type \u0026lsquo;terminal\u0026rsquo; in the search window) and then typing in these two commands (or copy and paste). The first command starts at the / and ends at the \u0026quot; and you must include the entire line from slash to closing quotation mark:  /bin/bash -c \u0026quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)\u0026quot; and when that finishes,\nbrew install git Make a new directory on your computer with the same name as the repo you created above. For my screenshotted example above, that would be week-two. On a PC, find the folder in your file explorer; click on it so that\u0026rsquo;s the folder displayed in the address bar at the top of the explorer. Then, click in the address bar and type cmd and hit enter. This will open a command prompt window for that folder, allowing you to type commands in directly. On a Mac, go to System Preferences, select Keyboard \u0026gt; Shortcuts \u0026gt; Services. Look for \u0026lsquo;New Terminal at Folder\u0026rsquo; and tick the box. Open your finder; find the folder you created, right-click and select \u0026lsquo;open Terminal here\u0026rsquo;.  A Quick Primer for Working at the Command Line or Terminal\nThe following two videos, one for PC, one for Mac, show you how to do this. For reference\u0026rsquo;s sake, this is what \u0026lsquo;working at the command prompt\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;working at the terminal\u0026rsquo; look like on your machine. When you interact with your computer, you can do it through a graphical interface - icons, clicks, etc - or you can directly type in commands. It\u0026rsquo;s this latter kind of interaction that most people think of as \u0026lsquo;coding\u0026rsquo;, but for us, this is just \u0026lsquo;opening the hood\u0026rsquo;.\n PC:\n  Mac:\n  Key commands for PC:\n dir show the contents of the current directory cls clear the window so that it\u0026rsquo;s fresh again cd directory-name change director to the named directory cd .. change directory up one level if you hit the up or down arrows you can cycle through the history of commands you\u0026rsquo;ve already typed  Key commands for Mac:\n ls list the contents of the current directory pwd print the path (location) of the current directory cd directory-name change director to the named directory cd .. change directory up one level history prints out the entire history of commands you\u0026rsquo;ve typed this session up and down arrows will cycle through this list  Do you see where, in your browser at github, it says ...or create a new repository on the command line? With your command prompt or terminal open in the appropriate folder on your machine (remember, folders on your machine = repos on github), type in each line exactly as it is there (beginning with echo), hitting enter at the end of each line, in order. If the command works, you\u0026rsquo;ll just be presented with the next prompt. The computer only ever responds when there is output to print - which often means only when there is an error message to report. (nb Git might prompt you to enter your email and name, as it does in the PC video, the first time you ever do this).  Ta da! You can now go to github.com\\\u0026lt;your-user-name\u0026gt;\\your-repo and you\u0026rsquo;ll see it all there tickety boo.\nMaking a new text file on Github You can make a new text file by clicking on the \u0026lsquo;create new file\u0026rsquo; button; remember to always use .md as the file extension. You can specify headers, links, images, bullets, blockquotes and so on by using markdown conventions\nThe two videos below might be a bit clearer on youtube itself.\n  Uploading a file into Github You can add new files from your computer by dragging and dropping them into the main repository. At the end of this video, I show you how to display the image in the text of the reflection.\n  ","description":"Github nuts and bolts","id":27,"section":"building","tags":null,"title":"Guidance for Github","uri":"https://dhmuse.netlify.app/building/github-guidance/"},{"content":"Goal The goal here is to create a kind of guide to a selected notebook that shows what the notebook can do. It walks the user through the notebook, how to use it, perhaps visualize results or ways to extend it, in order to suggest questions a user might want to pose, and why it might matter. That last point is the most \u0026lsquo;case study\u0026rsquo;-ish bit. By providing guidance on the \u0026lsquo;so what\u0026rsquo; question, you will engage with the literature or issues and provide context for non-dh-minded folk should take this work seriously.\nParameters  A single markdown page with footnotes.* You should have a proper text editor like Sublime Text or Atom installed; compose your document using the text editor.  Footnotes can be formatted in markdown like so:\nFootnotes[^1] are added in-text like so ...\nand then at the end of the document, like this:\n[^1]: Graham, S. 2006. _Ex Figlinis_. BAR International Series: Oxford. *It is possible to make an online slideshow out of a markdown document. You might wish to format your document that way. If you do, use this template on the HackMD platform. You can log in with your Github username. Copy it into your text editor; make your edits in your text editor and save locally. When you\u0026rsquo;re ready to test, paste it all into a new note on HackMd, then \u0026lsquo;view in slideshow mode\u0026rsquo; under the sharing button. You can then submit the URL to the slideshow mode version.\nThe two slide shows on the Glam Workbench main page are generated this way.\n Use clear headings and header levels to signal a clear, logical, flow.  Be succinct.  Illustrate. Create screenshots \u0026amp; illustrate these with arrows, circles, etc to make it clear what\u0026rsquo;s going on. On a Mac, you can use cmd+4 to take a screenshot, and then the preview app to annotate it. On a PC, the snip-it tool can be used the same way. Change the names of the files to your-surname-fig-1.png (or .jpg, as appropriate) and so on, so that I don\u0026rsquo;t lose track of things. Insert images into your document with markdown: ![alt-descriptive-text](your-surname-fig-1.png).  Video walkthroughs can be helpful too. I use the free version of https://screencast-o-matic.com/ . The resulting file can be saved on your computer and then placed in your repository; it can also be uploaded to your userspace on screencast-o-matic and then can be embedded from there. If you load it to your own repo, just flag where the video should go, e.g., ~insert video 1 here~ and I\u0026rsquo;ll do the rest when I compile everything. Otherwise, use the embed code from screencast-o-matic. Mac users can also make quick videos using cmd+5; Windows 10 users can use the x-box app screenrecorder (press Windows+G) (more info for Windows).  Provide a link to launch the binder in a live environment.  Full and accurate citations in a \u0026lsquo;References\u0026rsquo; list at the end. Chicago style is fine.  Remember to address the goals for this exercise. The most important of these: Imagine someone from the Ottawa GLAM community looking at your work; they\u0026rsquo;ll (politely) be thinking \u0026lsquo;so what?', also known as the \u0026lsquo;what\u0026rsquo;s in it for me?'. That is to say, why does this notebook matter?  When its ready, put a copy of it in a github repo. You can submit the link to it here so I can keep track.  Your Notebook Documentation Is Due at the End of the Course \u0026hellip;but I will accept it up to ten days after the final day of the Winter term (which this year is April 14; thus, April 24th.)\nI will bundle everyone\u0026rsquo;s notebooks and documentation together into a supporting website, the Ottawa GLAM Workbench (fyi, repo here) and used the My Binder service to make these live online.\n","description":"Expectations for content and format","id":28,"section":"building","tags":null,"title":"Guidance for your Notebook Reflection","uri":"https://dhmuse.netlify.app/building/cs-guidance/"},{"content":"Prerequisites You need to have the following installed on your machine:\n Python. I recommend using Anaconda to manage all of your python related work. Get Anaconda here and get the 3.7 version. In the instructions below, you will also be installing Homebrew if you are on a Mac. Both PC and Windows people will need to install the command line interface (CLI) for Heroku. I recommend Mac people install Homebrew so that they can download the CLI from their terminal (also, lots of useful software is distributed using Homebrew). Windows people don\u0026rsquo;t need Homebrew; they can install the CLI installer for Windows from the Heroku page.  What is Heroku? Heroku is a platform for delivering web apps. For our purposes, it\u0026rsquo;s free. The 0.50$ tour - a simple server just delivers basic static webpages to the web. If you want some kind of interactivity, or you\u0026rsquo;re doing complex database driven queries and functions, you need a server with a lot more power. Heroku does that. In my guidance on using Datasette with Glitch you learned that Glitch can host very small datasets using Glitch\u0026rsquo;s collaborative coding environment. This is great for when you want to quickly test something out, or share very small data, but it\u0026rsquo;s not a good solution if you want to put larger materials online. We\u0026rsquo;ll use Heroku for that.\nHere we go! 1. Create a python environment for your work Open a new terminal (Mac) or start up Conda and start a new terminal window (Windows). (Windows users, look for \u0026lsquo;command prompt for powershell anaconda\u0026rsquo; and start that.) I make a version of python - an \u0026lsquo;environment\u0026rsquo; - just for working with this course by using the command $ conda create, like so:\n$ conda create --name dhmuse\nand pressing y for \u0026lsquo;yes, i do want to create a pythion environment called \u0026lsquo;dhmuse\u0026rsquo;'. There are many different packages or bundles of python-legos out there that can be combined to do lots of different things. You create environments to manage all of these pieces so that you don\u0026rsquo;t create conflicts. I create an environment for analytical work, or for creative work, or for database work, or for a unique project, so that my different pieces of code have just the right pieces they need. Then, I can remind myself what conda environments I have by entering:\n$ conda env list\nand can then select the one I want by typing it in after the \u0026lsquo;activate\u0026rsquo; command:\n$ conda activate dhmuse\nWhen I\u0026rsquo;m finished, I can type\n$ conda deactivate\nand I\u0026rsquo;m done. Remember! The convention when writing about code is to provide the command prompt $ or \u0026gt; but you do not enter that prompt yourself!\n2. Install datasette and csvs-to-sqlite At the $ prompt in your new environment which has been activated (you\u0026rsquo;ll see the name of your environment now appearing in your command line), you\u0026rsquo;ll install a utility that converts csvs to sqlite format; that is, from a plain table to a table formatted for use with sql powered databases:\n$ pip install csvs-to-sqlite\nThen\n$ pip install datasette\nbecause we are installing inside the environment we just created these particular commands (packages; boxes of code legos) will not be available after you type conda deactivate. They live inside this environment only.\n More info about CSVS-toSQLITE https://github.com/simonw/csvs-to-sqlite More info about Datasette https://datasette.readthedocs.io  3. Convert your table of data to a database Now we convert your csv table of data to a sql database:\n$ csvs-to-sqlite your-data-table.csv your-database.db\nWhen it finishes running, check it out via datasette:\n$ datasette your-datasette.db\nTa da! Your data is running probably at http://127.0.0.1:8001. Check it out! Hit ctrl+c in your terminal to stop it.\n4. Publish to the web; install Heroku command line tools Now we\u0026rsquo;re going to publish to the web, putting it on space at heroku\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re on a Mac, get homebrew to install heroku by running these command:\n$ /usr/bin/ruby -e \u0026quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\u0026quot;\n$ brew tap heroku/brew \u0026amp;\u0026amp; brew install heroku\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re on Windows, download and run the installer.\n5. Get an account at Heroku Now, go to Heroku.com and make an account. Keep note of your username and your password, you\u0026rsquo;ll need them.\n6. Login to Heroku at the command line Back in the terminal/command line, now that Heroku is installed, tell it you want to login to your account:\n$ heroku login -i\nIt\u0026rsquo;ll ask you for your username and password; enter them.\nDrumroll please!\n7. Publish to the web Now we publish your database file to the web:\n$ datasette publish heroku --name cstm-demo cstm.db\nwhere the --name flag is the subdomain you want your data to be available at. In my case, my choice of \u0026lsquo;cstm-demo\u0026rsquo; becomes available at http://cstm-demo.herokuapp.com\nReference The publish-to-heroku command has many options:\n$ datasette publish heroku --help\nUsage: datasette publish heroku [OPTIONS] [FILES]...

The Associate Dean of the Faculty conducts a rigorous investigation, including an interview with the student, when an instructor suspects a piece of work has been plagiarized. Penalties are not trivial. They can include a final grade of \u0026ldquo;F\u0026rdquo; for the course.\nCOURSE SHARING WEBSITES and COPYRIGHT To the degree that I am able, all original content on this course website is released under creative commons licensed.

This is used when there is an allegation of an academic offence. The notation is replaced with the appropriate grade for the course as soon as it is available.\nIP\tIn Progress – a notation (IP) assigned to a course by a faculty member when: At the undergraduate level, an undergraduate thesis or course has not been completed by the end of the period of registration.\nWDN\tWithdrawn. No academic credit, no impact on the CGPA. WDN is a permanent notation that appears on the official transcript for students who withdraw after the full fee adjustment date in each term (noted in the Academic Year section of the Calendar each term). Students may withdraw on or before the last day of classes.\nStanding in a course is determined by the course instructor subject to the approval of the Faculty Dean. This means that grades submitted by the instructor may be subject to revision. No grades are final until they have been approved by the Dean.\nWITHDRAWAL WITHOUT ACADEMIC PENALTY January 31, 2021: Last day for a full fee adjustment (financial withdrawal). Withdrawals after this date will result in a permanent notation of WDN on the official transcript.\nApril 14, 2021: Last day for academic withdrawal.\nREQUESTS FOR ACADEMIC ACCOMMODATIONS You may need special arrangements to meet your academic obligations during the term. For an accommodation request the processes are as follows:\nPregnancy obligation: write to the professor with any requests for academic accommodation during the first two weeks of class, or as soon as possible after the need for accommodation is known to exist.

Rather, I am trying to help you learn the skills that you will need to uncover whatever aspect of method and thought that will help you with your research goals. A big part of that is trying to teach how to deal with what might feel like \u0026lsquo;failure\u0026rsquo;, on first blush. I want you to swing for the bleachers, and not to be afraid of whiffing on the ball. After all, to mix sporting metaphors, you\u0026rsquo;re here for icetime not the Stanley Cup.\nOn another note, this course originally was intended to be a kind of hybrid course, blending face to face work in the classroom with resources and digital tools.\nThat of course, can\u0026rsquo;t happen at the moment.\nMoving online just means that I have to work harder at fostering the social aspect of learning and education.\nSocial Contact Another problem with moving fully online is isolation. Working with digital tools and environments, especially when you\u0026rsquo;re not overly familiar with how they work - or even the underlying metaphors that would help you make sense of what\u0026rsquo;s going on - is frustrating. Bad enough when you have classmates you see twice a week and can at least complain with over coffee later; extremely awful when you\u0026rsquo;re on a bad internet connection and everyone thinks that you\u0026rsquo;re not really doing schoolwork.\nIn past classes, I have used Slack as a way of trying to meet that need for human connection that makes learning meaningful. It worked, more or less, but if there was a conversation going on and you missed part of it, it could just feel overwhelming and impenetrable.\nAnd it was one more damned thing to install. One more damned thing to get a password for.\nI tried Zulipchat another year. Same problem again.\nThis year, as I write this, I\u0026rsquo;m trying Discord, for its voice and screensharing integration. We\u0026rsquo;ll see how that goes.\nThis work is a team sport.

You are not alone.\r This website is built using Hugo, a static site builder. Static sites are quicker, more secure, and separate content from container, thus making them more sustainable. I write all of the content in individual text files, which I can then turn into whatever output - html, pdf, word doc - that I need. My writing is freed from subscription-based software that might lock it in. I push all of the text files onto github. Then, I have netlify.com watch those files for any changes.
