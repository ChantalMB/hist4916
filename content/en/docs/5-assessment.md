There is no midterm. There is no final exam.

You grade emerges from the following elements.

1. Discussion Leaders. Each student will be responsible to 'page prep' certain readings. Page prep involves:
	- Creating the Reading Overview: a brief overview page note attached to the assigned reading using Hypothes.is page notes
	- Creating the Reading Pre-seed: at least five rich/deep annotations on your chosen readings/materials (five total, not five per document)
	- In the relevant week, when the other students read the papers, the student responsible for 'page prep' will engage and respond to the annotations/responses of their peers in such a fashion as to dig deeper into the topic at hand
	- see the [guidance note](/building/dl-guidance) for more information

2. Collaborative Readers. Each student is responsible each week to respond in a timely fashion (eg, first half of the week) to overview annotations and seeded annotations such that the page preparer can respond in turn. This isn't a hard and fast weekly deadline; it's rather a courtesy from you to your peers. How many? Enough to have a conversation. See the [guidance note](/building/cr-guidance) for more information.

3. Each student will craft at least one Jupyter notebook that engages with a source of GLAM data in Ottawa. [See the 'Technical Notes' for more info on the mechanics](/building/nb-guidance). The notebook should do something meaningful with the data (at least two examples of 'something meaningful' within a single notebook). It could be a visualization of a certain subset of information. It could show how to map the material. It might make the material more easily available. Other things are possible. See the [examples in the wild](/building/technotes-toc).
	- the notebook will combine both the code and observations explaining what is going on, where the data is coming from, how to run the notebook.
	- the jupyter notebook will be kept under version control in Github.
	- see the [guidance note](/building/nb-guidance) for more information

4. Notebook Reflection. Each student will write a document to accompany the notebook that situates what the notebook does in the broader literature and discussion that we have already examined. It might walk the user through the notebook to suggest further questions a user might want to pose, and why it might matter, or ways the work could be extended.. This will be written as a text file using [Markdown conventions](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet), that cites readings and other pertinent materials; it might also link to relevant annotations in our discussions. See the [guidance note](/building/nb-guidance) for more information.

Nobody in the field works in isolation. Collaboration, mutual support, engagement, teamwork, etc, will be rewarded.

### Grading

I am required by the University to provide a percentage breakdown for the assessment exercises.

+ Discussion leading: 20% (graded: satisfactory / meh /unsatisfactory)
+ Collaborative reading: 20% (graded: satisfactory / meh / unsatisfactory )
+ Jupyter Notebook: 20%  
+ Notebook Reflection: 40%

I reserve the right to adjust those percentages to take into account the particular circumstances of the student.

### Important dates:

+ Choose your own adventure to be completed by the end of week 2
+ Discussion leader prep to be completed by the end of week 4
+ Collaborative reading - completed each week weeks 5 - 8
+ Jupyter Notebook - aim to complete by week 11; submit by end of week 12
+ Notebook Reflection - due by the end of the exam period (April 27th). But please try to be finished earlier than that.
+ see also the [page on the breakdown of dates and time estimates for the digital skills building aspects of the course](/building/tech-req-at-a-glance).
