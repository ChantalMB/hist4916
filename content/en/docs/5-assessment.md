There is no midterm. There is no final exam.

You grade emerges from the following elements.

1. Discussion Leaders. Each student will be responsible to 'page prep' cetain readings. Page prep involves:
	- Creating the Reading Overview: a brief overview page note attached to the assigned reading using Hypothes.is page notes
	- Creating the Reading Pre-seed: at least five rich annotations on the assigned readings
	- In the relevant week, when the other students read the papers, the student responsible for 'page prep' will engage and respond to the annotations of their peers in such a fashion as to dig deeper into the topic at hand

2. Collaborative Readers. Each student is responsible each week to respond in a timely fashion (eg, first half of the week) to overview annotations and seeded annotations such that the page preparer can respond in turn. This isn't a hard and fast weekly deadline; it's rather a courtesy from you to your peers.

3. Each student will craft at least one Jupyter notebook that engages with a source of GLAM data in Ottawa. [See the 'Technical Notes' for more info on the mechanics](/building/). The notebook should do something meaningful with the data (at least two examples of 'something meaningful' within a single notebook). It could be a visualization of a certain subset of information. It could show how to map the material. It might make the material more easily available. Other things are possible.
	- the notebook will combine both the code and the documentation explaining what is going on, where the data is coming from, how to run the notebook.
	- the jupyter notebook will be kept under version control in Github.

4. Notebook Reflection. Each student will write a document to accompany the notebook that situates what the notebook does in the broader literature and discussion that we have already examined. It might walk the user through the notebook to suggest further questions a user might want to pose, and why it might matter, or ways the work could be extended.. This will be written as a text file using [Markdown conventions](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet), that cites readings and other pertinent materials; it might also link to relevant annotations in our discussions.

5. You also have the option to write an exit ticket reflecting on the entire process (see below). Again, this is **optional**.


### The Exit Ticket

**Optional** You may wish to produce an '[exit ticket](/building/et-guidance/)' for me at the end of the course (open format) reflecting on where you started and where you've gotten to. This document will indicate how you feel you've done against the [learning outcomes](docs/2-learning-outcomes); this is an opportunity for you to tell me what grade reflects your work best (see below for how meeting the outcomes translates to a grade). Please explicitly tie your exit ticket to the evidence of your journey (annotations, digital ephemera, etc). **Everyone's journey is different**. Digital methods are more a matter of practice and time than they are of aptitude.

Your 'exit ticket' will explain to me your particular context, and it will point to the evidence that demonstrates how you've moved along from where you were at the beginning to where you are now.

If I agree with your assessment, then that is the grade you will receive (thus, you have the opportunity to override the percentage breakdowns below).

**When I have disagreed in previous courses** this has been, 9.5 times out of 10, to _raise_ the grade: y'all are too hard on yourselves. If I have disagreed and felt that you've overstated things - if you were the 0.5 out of 10 - we would talk and come to an agreement.

The Exit Ticket, if you choose to do it, should be submitted within one week of the last day of the fall term.

Further guidance on the Exit Ticket is available under the [Technical Notes](/building/et-guidance/).

### Grading

**make sure these agree with the learning outcomes**

Remembering the [learning outcomes](docs/2-learning-outcomes),

|Learning Outcome|A|B|C|D|eg. Jo Q Student|
|----------------|-|-|-|-|-|
|1. analytical ability|-|-|-|-|X|
|2. methodology|-|-|-|-|-|
|3. collaboration|-|-|-|-|X|
|4. argumentation|-|-|-|-|X|
|5. professionalization|-|-|-|-|-|

...5/5 would be an A, 4/5 would be a B, 3/5 would be a C, 2/5 a D.

{{< alert theme="info" >}}
In this example, based on my consideration of Jo Q Student's evidence and the feedback I'd written him over the six weeks, it seemed to me that he did what she needed to do (satisfactorily) for 3 out of the 5 outcomes and so earned a C. However, her exit ticket might bring her up.

### Percentage Breakdown

I am required by the University to provide a percentage breakdown.

+ Discussion leading: 20% (graded: satisfactory / meh /unsatisfactory)
+ Collaborative reading: 20% (graded: satisfactory / meh / unsatisfactory )
+ Jupyter Notebook: 20%  
+ Notebook Reflection: 40% 
+ Exit Ticket: optional

Important dates:
+ Discussion leader prep to be completed by the end of week 4
+ Collaborative reading - completed each week weeks 5 - 8
+ Jupyter Notebook - aim to complete by week 11; submit by week 12
+ Notebook Reflection - due 10 days after the end of term.

I reserve the right to adjust those percentages to take into account the particular circumstances of the student. Note that depending on your argument in the Exit Ticket, I can be persuaded the adjust those percentages to put more weight on one thing rather than another, etc.
