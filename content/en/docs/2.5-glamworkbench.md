## Tangible Output of this Class

Each of you will produce a [computational notebook](/building/nb-guidance/) - a kind of website that has code within it that can be run, together with text and images describing what's going on - that is focussed on the Ottawa GLAM scene.

All of these notebooks will be gathered together by me into an 'Ottawa GLAM Workbench' (taking our cue from the inspiring work of [Tim Sherratt and his GLAM Workbench](https://glam-workbench.github.io/) on Australian and New Zealand's cultural heritage).

You will produce [a case study](/building/cs-guidance/) using one of our notebooks (yours or one of your peer's); collaboration is encouraged. These case studies will be integrated into the workbench after the class is finished.

## HeritageJam

Last year, when I ran this course, the idea was to use the course as a platform to launch the [HeritageJam](http://www.heritagejam.org/) jam event, with online and in-person components. The pandemic of course kiboshed that. This year, I still want to run HeritageJam, and I'd like to have our Ottawa GlAM Workbench play a central role as a resource for a fully-online event. I have funds to support this, and I hope to be able to hire one or two of you to help develop the Ottawa GLAM Workbench further, and to help put the event on.
