Transcript of this week's podcast episode.

### Part One

So this week is an important week in the class. This is the week where you get to choose your own DHMuse adventure. And by choose your own adventure. I mean- you know the first time I did this class I had a huge list of readings that I wanted everybody to get through. It was in fact quite overwhelming. Both for the students and for myself. So we're going to do it differently this time.

This time I want you to take a look at our library of materials, which you can find on the website, and select three of the possible readings there that seem to intersect with you and your interests from at least two of the different areas.

And then you go to the choose your own DH Muse Adventure website, click on the big plus sign, which will open up a little panel, very much like Tumblr, a little box for you to enter in put your materials in there. And then, We will look at these things and we will arrange them into a schedule that makes thematic sense by consensus.

And we'll do that [consensus] in the discord space, okay? So there'll be a lot of talking a lot of back and forth in there. And then I'll add connections to the different, the different panels. So that we can see it and I'll update the website with the relevant weeks on the course.

So that, It all gets settled out. So that's the first task for this week. The second task is I want you to go to Tim Sherratt's Glam workbench and just explore it. See what he has done; get a sense of the possibilities; look at how he has engaged with GLAM materials from Australia and New Zealandm and think about- especially- the kinds of tacit knowledge, the hidden steps, the little gotchas that are required to be made explicit for you in order to get through this stuff.

Okay, so that's the task for this week.
