Transcript of this week's podcast episode.

### Part One

When I was a kid, I lived in the hinterland of Ottawa. One year, when I was in elementary school, I got selected to go to Ottawa to hear Marc Garneau speak at the Science and Technology Museum - he had just returned from his first mission on the space shuttle. It was very exciting. After the talk, I got separated from the rest of the group. I was completely lost, completely overwhelmed, and utterly bewildered. So much stuff! They found me, apparently, in the gallery devoted to computers.

Seems like I've been a nerd for a very, very long time.

Welcome to DHMuse! This course is my attempt to understand the landscape of cultural heritage informatics, especially here in Ottawa. I'm glad you've decided to join me in this attempt. How do museums and other organizations in the ‘GLAM’ sector (galleries, libraries, archives, museums) keep track of their collections? To what purpose? What might happen if we release these collections into the wild (via the internet)? If we mash these collections together what might we see, and why might it matter? Where are the dangers - and to whom could it be dangerous?

Now, my background is not in museums. You might say, it's museum-adjacent. I'm an archaeologist by training and there is of course a natural connection there between archaeologists and museum curators.

\[ clip of Indiana Jones; \] It belongs in a museum!

But I'm also the official digital humanities guy, the official digital historian, the digital archaeologist, in the department. So I've been trying to learn how all of these different fields intersect, especially with material culture, the _things_ of history. That is, I think I'm working maybe in 'cultural heritage informatics'. I hadn't even heard the term until oh around six or seven years ago when I saw Ethan Watrall, an archaeologist at Michigan State University, using it to describe a training programme he'd developed for his grad students.

Cultural Heritage Informatics. I *like* it. It seems to me that the intersection of digital history, material cutlure, museums, galleries, libraries and archives might be found within the broader field of ‘cultural heritage informatics’. Cultural heritage materials require careful description and organization to permit effective curation, preservation, management, and research. You may have heard the term ‘bioinformatics’ before; that field defines itself as

> ‘the interdisciplinary field that studies and pursues the effective uses of biomedical data, information, and knowledge for scientific inquiry, problem solving and decision making, motivated by efforts to improve human health.’ (Kulikowski et al 2012)

…in which case, we could define CHI similarly as an interdisciplinary field studying and pursuing the effective use of cultural heritage data, information, and knowledge for humanistic or scientific inquiry, problem solving, and decision making, motivated by efforts to **improve human welfare**. I added the emphasis there to make an important point. The decisions we make about **information** are necessarily **ethical** decisions. Computers operate by replicating the decisions we make, at enormous speed and scale. The consequences can be unintended and unforeseen, and so we have to begin from an ethical perspective that considers from the outset: who will this harm?

By now, you've had a chance to look over this course website. The entire course is designed to be asynchronous; I don't know about you, but I could live happily without ever being in another zoom meeting. But just because this is asynchronous, it doesn't mean that we don't have a time table to keep, a schedule to observe.

Each week, there are things that need to get done, in order for us to achieve our goals. By the end of this course, I want you to have built a digital computational notebook that engages with information from one of the galleries, libraries, archives, or museums in Ottawa. It might do an analysis; it might be a creative re-imagining; it might be something else entirely.

We're taking inspiration from the work of Australian digital historian Tim Sherratt, who has built what he calls the GLAM Workbench. We're going to put together a version of this from these notebooks that you will make. Thanks to the Students as Partners Programme, I've also been supported in building this course by Chantal Brousseau, who is doing her history degree with a computer science minor. She is also your classmate and another resource person who can help troubleshoot the tech side of things.

I want to make it clear that you do not **need** to be techy to be successful in this course. I know that everyone comes with different comfort levels. My concern - and how I grade - is that you are open and honest about what has worked and what hasn't, and that you think through the *why* of that. I can't emphasize enough: in tech work, we learn far more from when things break than from things that work the first time. I want you to break things.

It'll be awesome. Trust me.

The first third of this course then will consist of a tune-up of your digital skills. You will also select some materials to explore in more detail, plotting your own adventure through the CHI literature. You'll then prepare detailed annotations of this material to share with everyone else.

Then, in the second third of the course, we will look at those materials, and respond to your annotations: basically, we will have a distributed conversation around this literature.

This will then set us up for the final third of the course where, using our digital skills and grounding the work in the literature we've just explored, you will create the computational notebook. You will also write documentation that situates that notebook, so that someone might understand the value, utility, and possibilities that the notebook allows.

All of these I will bundle up at the end of the course and turn into a website, the Ottawa GLAM Workbench. 

Cool, eh?

After you've finished listening to this podcast, read through the syllabus - it's critically important that you do this, since this class is probably very unlike any others you've taken - join the class discord, say hello. Read and start following the instructions for week 1. Sort out a github account (which can be pseudonymous, as long as you let me know what your pseudonym is!). Get the hypothesis account, annotate anything you don't understand or are nervous about in the syllabus and the instructions. You're gonna do great. When life intervenes - and it will - just let me know that something's going on. I don't need to know the details; I trust you. Let me know, and we'll come up with alternatives for you to be successful. There's nothing we can't roll with, if you're willing to trust me.

One last thing - from time to time there will be a course podcast for you to listen to. I have invited a number of professionals to reflect on their work and share that with us, so that you gain perspective from those in the field.

Today, we'll finish off by hearing from Erica Vanden Bosch , Manager of Information Management Services for Ingenium, the Crown Corporation that runs the Science and Technology Museum, the Aviation Museum, and the Food and Agriculture Museum.
