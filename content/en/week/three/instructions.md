Each reading is 'seeded' with annotations by this week's Discussion Leader; some of the annotations may contain video from the Discussion Leader directing you to pay attention to particular issues or ideas. **Annotate** with your own reactions and thoughts, react to the Discussion Leader's annotations, and anything else interesting you find with Hypothes.is, keeping in mind what you've already heard/read. **Remember** you must be logged into our reading group.

A good annotation draws connections between what you've read and other things you've read/heard/experienced. I explicitly encourage you to connect what you read in this class with what you're reading/doing in other classes. Also add anything you read or anything interesting you find to your Zotero library.


### Do

Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks

1. this
2. that
3. the other thing

{{< notice success "Important" >}} With tech work, if it doesn't come together in about 30 minutes, it won't come in an hour. So take a break. Close the laptop. Call somebody up for help. Find another pair of eyes to look at the problem. I don't want to hear that you labored heroically for 2 hours to do something. Jump into our social space and ask for advice.

### Log your work

Each week, I would like you to log your final thoughts on the discussion [using this form](https://forms.gle/jg2YzhLrnLMLYSqH7). **This is required, and counts towards your DL or CR portion of the grade**.

On this same form, if you have technical work that you require help with or would like me to take a look, you can log the link to the repo you're working from.
