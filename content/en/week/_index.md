The course has four parts:

Part One: Foundations: Cultural Heritage & Information -> in which we lay the groundwork for what this course will explore, its larger contexts, and what the major research questions are.

Part Two: Representations -> in which we consider the ways cultural heritage is represented and the creative work of curation and interpretation

Part Three: Creative Engagement -> in which we develop our own cultural heritage informatics infrastructure and explore the ways such infrastructure permits research and creativity

Part Four: Money -> in which we consider how to measure, why, and why it matters

The readings are enumerated to show which part they speak to; see [claiming your topic as Discussion Leader](week/get-started/instructions/#claim-your-topic-as-discussion-leader). Then, find the week in which we'll 'discuss' online through our annotations those particular readings.
