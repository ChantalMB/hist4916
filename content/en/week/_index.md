The course covers four broad areas:

Foundations: Cultural Heritage & Information -> in which we lay the groundwork for what this course will explore, its larger contexts, and what the major research questions are.

Representations -> in which we consider the ways cultural heritage is represented and the creative work of curation and interpretation

Creative Engagement -> in which we develop our own cultural heritage informatics infrastructure and explore the ways such infrastructure permits research and creativity

Money -> in which we consider how to measure, why, and why it matters

The precise content for a given week will emerge from our engagement in the course. Stay tuned, and check in often!
