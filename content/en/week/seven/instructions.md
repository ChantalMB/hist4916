We continue our discussion. We transform that conventional model for a seminar from live face to face to a distributed, asynchronous model through [collaborative reading & generous thinking](building/cr-guidance/)

### Goals for this week

1. Engage meaningfully with the discussion as prepared for you by your peers

### Read

Dr. Graham will direct you to the appropriate materials for this week once we have settled our schedule.

### Do

**Discussion Leaders**: Discussion leaders will remain alert and will respond to posts and queries on their respective articles. They should not spend more than an hour total on responses this week.

**Collaborative Readers**: The discussion leaders for this week have prepared a motley of materials. Begin by reading their 'page level' annotations - the overview - and then use that to guide your deeper engagement. I'm looking for at least three meaningful interactions with _the discussion leader's thoughts_. Is that clear? I'm not saying 3 per article, etc. Rather, this week you are engaging with what your peer has observed, thought, drawn attention to, etc.
