I wanted this course to be about exploration and figuring out what this field, CHI, meant for this sector, GLAM. As we built this course in the fall, I realized I was making a huge mistake. It was too controlled. Too rigid. Too much about me. When we go to a museum, library, gallery, or archive... it's all about you, and _your_ exploration. That's how meaning emerges, right? So we tried to come up with a way for you to set the agenda and still meet the learning goals.  

### Goals for this week

1. Settle the schedule
2. Explore the GLAMWorkbench

### Listen

Episode 2 of course podcast goes here.

### Do

1. [Choose Your Own DHMuse Adventure](https://padlet.com/shawngraham1/jnpyi1hmkjbtzbp0). Open that link in a new window. Add a tile by selecting 3 possible readings from at least two areas in [our library](building/library); find something we should watch; and find something to explore. Then we will arrive at a path through these materials by consensus, resolving any conflicts, discussing in the appropriate discord space. I'll then wire them up as appropriately, and assign dates. Click on the giant plus sign to begin.
2. Explore the [Glam Workbench](https://glam-workbench.github.io/). One of the outcomes for this course is for us, as a class, to create a simpler version of this. What kinds of 'tacit knowledge' are required to be made explicit for you to work with this material? Discuss in our discord space.

{{< notice success "Important" >}} By all means, try some of the more technical aspects of the GLAMWorkbench. But remember: with tech work, if it doesn't come together in about 30 minutes, it won't come in an hour. So take a break. Close the laptop. Call somebody up for help. Find another pair of eyes to look at the problem. I don't want to hear that you labored heroically for 2 hours to do something. Jump into our social space and ask for advice.
