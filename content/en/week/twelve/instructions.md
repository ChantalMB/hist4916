### Goals for this week

1. Finish crafting your notebook; I will collate these into a OttawaGLAM Workbench.
2. Write up documentation for your notebook; the 'notebook reflection' aka the 'case study'.

Remember to consult the [Guidance on Building Your Own Notebook](building/nb-guidance) and the [Guidance for your Notebook Documentation](building/cs-guidance), and the [Sequence of Technical Work document](https://dhmuse.netlify.app/building/tech-req-at-a-glance/). TALK about what you're doing in Discord; ask for help from others or from me. I am happy for you to collaborate on both these tasks; just talk to me so that we can be clear about expectations.

### Listen

Listen to the final episode of the podcast


### Do

1. Submit your jupyter notebook by logging it [here](https://forms.gle/RZH4o6H18L1sMBz88) at the end of this week.
1. Write up a notebook reflection document that _contextualizes_ what your notebook does, and how it fits into broader trends within the GLAM sector. See [the guidance](building/cs-guidance). This will be due no later than 10 days after the end of term, please.

{{< notice success "Important" >}} With tech work, if it doesn't come together in about 30 minutes, it won't come in an hour. So take a break. Close the laptop. Call somebody up for help. Find another pair of eyes to look at the problem. I don't want to hear that you labored heroically for 2 hours to do something. Jump into our social space and ask for advice.

### Submit your notebook and documentation links to me

I would like you to log those links to me [using this form](https://forms.gle/RZH4o6H18L1sMBz88).
