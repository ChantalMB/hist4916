### Goals for this week

1. Write up documentation for your notebook.
2. that
3. the other thing

### Listen

Listen to the final episode of the podcast


### Do

1. Write up a document that _contextualizes_ what your notebook does, and how it fits into broader trends within the GLAM sector. Suggest questions the notebook might answer for a user; suggest why that matters. You might also want to suggest ways in which the user might extend the notebook further.

{{< notice success "Important" >}} With tech work, if it doesn't come together in about 30 minutes, it won't come in an hour. So take a break. Close the laptop. Call somebody up for help. Find another pair of eyes to look at the problem. I don't want to hear that you labored heroically for 2 hours to do something. Jump into our social space and ask for advice.
