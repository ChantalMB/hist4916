>A seminar is a form of academic instruction, either at an academic institution or offered by a commercial or professional organization.[citation needed] It has the function of bringing together small groups for recurring meetings, focusing each time on some particular subject, in which everyone present is requested to participate. This is often accomplished through an ongoing Socratic dialogue with a seminar leader or instructor, or through a more formal presentation of research. It is essentially a place where assigned readings are discussed, questions can be raised and debates can be conducted.

Thus spake Wikipedia (Wikipedia has a surprising amount of [GLAM projects going on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:GLAM/Projects) by the way).

Over these next four weeks, we transform that conventional model from live face to face to a distributed, asynchronous model through [collaborative reading & generous thinking](building/cr-guidance/)

### Goals for this week

1. Engage meaningfully with the discussion as prepared for you by your peers.

### Read

Start with Jenna, Jacob, and Kieran's selections on the [cyoa page](https://padlet.com/shawngraham1/jnpyi1hmkjbtzbp0).

### Do

**Discussion Leaders**: Discussion leaders will remain alert and will respond to posts and queries on their respective articles. They should not spend more than an hour total on responses this week.

**Collaborative Readers**: The discussion leaders for this week have prepared a motley of materials. Begin by reading their 'page level' annotations - the overview - and then use that to guide your deeper engagement. I'm looking for at least three meaningful interactions with _the discussion leader's thoughts_. Is that clear? I'm not saying 3 per article, etc. Rather, this week you are engaging with what your peer has observed, thought, drawn attention to, etc.
