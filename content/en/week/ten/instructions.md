Seneler, Cagla. 2017. The Effects Of Learning Styles And Cultural Background On Understanding The Information Architectures (IAs) Of Information Rich Websites Museums and the Web https://mw17.mwconf.org/paper/the-effects-of-learning-styles-and-cultural-background-on-understanding-the-information-architectures-ias-of-information-rich-websites/

Kelly, Lynda. 2016. The (post) digital visitor: What has (almost) twenty years of museum audience research revealed? Museums and the Web https://mw2016.museumsandtheweb.com/paper/the-post-digital-visitor-what-has-almost-20-years-of-museum-audience-research-revealed

Each reading is 'seeded' with annotations by this week's Discussion Leader; some of the annotations may contain video from the Discussion Leader directing you to pay attention to particular issues or ideas. **Annotate** with your own reactions and thoughts, react to the Discussion Leader's annotations, and anything else interesting you find with Hypothes.is, keeping in mind what you've already heard/read. **Remember** you must be logged into our reading group. 

A good annotation draws connections between what you've read and other things you've read/heard/experienced. I explicitly encourage you to connect what you read in this class with what you're reading/doing in other classes. Also add anything you read or anything interesting you find to your Zotero library.


### Do

1. supporting materials to be provided as per class interests, (direct students to consider craftingdh and digiarch materials), just more time to build the supporting website
2. that
3. the other thing

{{< notice success "Important" >}} With tech work, if it doesn't come together in about 30 minutes, it won't come in an hour. So take a break. Close the laptop. Call somebody up for help. Find another pair of eyes to look at the problem. I don't want to hear that you labored heroically for 2 hours to do something. Jump into our social space and ask for advice.

### Log your work 

Upload any of your technical work to your own private repo at the end of the week.
