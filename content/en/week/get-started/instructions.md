## Do this the moment you see this:

1. Get Hypothesis & Join Our Class Group **right now!**
2. Claim your topic as 'Discussion Leader' **by Saturday**
3. Join our Discord space **right now!**
4. Set up a Github account if you don't already have one.

## Get Hypothesis & Join Our Class Group

reate an account at [hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is):

![](https://d242fdlp0qlcia.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/08/28181440/signin.png)

Get the Chrome app or the Firefox bookmarklet:

![](https://d242fdlp0qlcia.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/08/28181440/install.png)

Make sure you're logged in:

![](https://d242fdlp0qlcia.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/08/28181440/signin2.png)

Then join [our HIST4916a reading group](https://hypothes.is/groups/AQerk76W/4916a-museums-dh). If you happen to be reading something, and see an existing annotation that interests you, hit the 'reply' button on the annotation to start a conversation! Sometimes, the person to whom you're replying might be a previous year's student, but that's ok; they might enter into conversation with you. Sometimes, it might be a person who isn't a Carleton student but is following along with the course. That's ok too. Be respectful!

[There is a student guide to Hypothes.is behind this link](https://web.hypothes.is/quick-start-guide-for-students/). Read that for the full information how using Hypothesis.

{{< notice success "Important" >}} Hypothesis is the main tool we use to enable an asynchronous seminar discussion. Hypothesis exists on the open web, so make sure you're always making your annotations in the **group space**, not the **public** space. Finally, you may use the [crowdlaaers](https://crowdlaaers.org/) service to keep track of the global development of our annotation space - go to that site, click on 'Groups', and follow the prompts to connect your Hypothesis account to the service.

## Join our Discord

Discord is a chat server that also allows voice, video, and screensharing. We will use it in this class mostly as a social space and a space to get help, especially in the more technical aspects of what we're doing.

{{< notice success "Important" >}} I don't want heroic lone scholars. If you are struggling with something - whether it's the ideas in the readings or the tech - look for help; DM me privately, or post in the relevant week's channel. If you can help someone, jump in. **I encourage collaboration**. If you get help from someone, just acknowledge it in your own work. Also: **in tech work, if it doesn't come in 30 minutes, it won't come in 3 hours** Asking for help is not a weakness: it's a sign of strength & scholarly maturity.
{{< /notice >}}

You can download Discord [here](https://discordapp.com/apps) or you can [use it in a broswer](https://discordapp.com/app).

You will receive an invitation email in your Carleton account. It expires after one day, so do join once you get it. It will ask to verify your email; check your spam folder.

Once you're in, there's a welcome message with a reaction emoji at the end - click on the thumbs up to confirm that you've read the message. This will unlock the various channels in the server, including voice and screensharing.

And yes, I recycled screenshots from my Crafting Digital History course, but the Digital Archaeology version is more or less the same and hey, I built this course website by hand.

![click-the-reaction](/images/discord/click-here.png)
(Alex is a student who works for me on [the bone trade project](http://bonetrade.github.io) if you were wondering.)

You can customize your profile by clicking on the cogwheel icon at the bottom of the navigation:

![options](/images/discord/options-location.png)

![user-info](/images/discord/user-info.png)

and you can customize how you'd like to use voice and video:

![voice](/images/discord/voice-settings.png)

There's a channel for each week's materials, a channel for general museum or Carleton chat, and a social channel just for shooting the breeze. If you want to chat or stream your machine (eg to show us what you're trying to do and how it's not working) just click on one of the side-chats - make sure you're unmuted! Dr. Graham also has a private office for voice and video and you can ask him directly to speak there.

What all the buttons do [help file](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/categories/200404398)

Discord has accessibility features, [more details here](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035966492-Screen-Reader-Data-Toggle)

## Get Setup with Github

{{< alert theme="info" >}}
If any of the instructions below are unclear, annotate this page with hypothesis while being logged into our course reading group. If you spot someone asking for help and you can offer advice, respond to the annotation.
{{< /alert >}}

#### Introduction

Github is a code sharing website often used by digital historians. 'Git' is a program that takes snapshots of the current state of a folder, and stores them in sequence, allowing you to revert your changes to an earlier state. It also allows you to create **branches**, or duplicates of your folder, so you can experiment. If you like the results of your work, you can **merge** that branch back into your original.

**Github therefore is a hub for sharing these git snapshots.**

A branch (a copy, a duplicate) of your work uploaded to Github could therefore be copied to say my account (a **fork**); then I might download to my machine to work on it (I've **pulled** it). Once I'm happy with my changes, I **commit** them (save them to the sequence of changes that Git tracks), and then I could **push** those changes to the **fork** in my account. I would then send you a **pull** request or notification, asking you to pull my changes back to your account; you could then decide whether or not to **merge**.

{{< alert theme="info" >}}
For our purposes, you will use Github mostly as a place to put your reflections or other pieces of work.
{{< /alert >}}

I might sometimes fork your work, pull it down onto my machine, make changes that I commit, push it back online, and ask you to pull the changes back. But that won't happen very often. **It takes a while to get comfortable with this.** There's a lot of useful code, in the cultural heritage informatics space, that gets shared on Github. Knowing the basics enables you to enter this world.

#### Get your account

1. Got to [github.com](http://github.com) and sign up for an account. You don't have to use your real name. (Protip: You might want to set up an email just for signing up for things.)

![github login screen](/images/github/github-signup1.png)

---

2. Verify your account.

![github account verification](/images/github/github-signup2.png)

---

3. Select the free tier (nb: I will never require you to pay for any reading, or any software. If something wants you to pay, **stop** and ask for help).

![github tier selection](/images/github/github-signup3.png)

---

4. Skip telling Github anything about yourself.

![github survey](/images/github/github-signup4.png)

---

5. Do the verification email thing. Once you hit the verification link in your email, you'll be brought back to Github to make a new repository:

![new repo](/images/github/github-new-repo.png)

---

6. Give it a reasonable name; tick the 'initialize with a readme' box, tick off the 'private' box, and hit the green commit button. (**Nb** It's your choice to choose public OR private):

![new repo settings](/images/github/github-new-repo-settings.png)

---

7. And on the final page, hit the 'dismiss' button in the 'Github Actions box'

![dismiss actions](/images/github/github-dismiss-actions.png)

Ta Da! You now have a github account, and you've created your first repository. **Going Forward** create a new repository for each week's work/reflection. You can create a new repository from the plus sign in the top right corner:

![another new repo](/images/github/new-repo.png)

**nb** Remember to tick off the 'initialize with a readme.md' file.

---

Once you've done that, you'll be at your Github user page:

![github user page](/images/github/github-signup5.png)

---

8. Add me as a collaborator to this and any subsequent **private** repositories you create for this course:

![manage access](/images/github/add-user-to-private-repo-1.png)

9. **Private Repo**: Then, once you've clicked on 'manage access', click on 'invite collaborator',
![add collaborator](/images/github/add-collaborator-to-private-repo-2.png)

10. **Private Repo**: Then find my username `shawngraham`, and add me:
![add shawngraham](/images/github/add-username-private-repo.png)

#### Setting up a 'repository' for your work

A 'repository' is just a folder that you've shared on Github. There are two ways to do this; the easy way and the more complex way. Luck you, you have _already_ done the easy way - you selected the `initialize with a readme`, and it's already present in your browser!

{{< alert theme="info" >}}
To create new repositories, just click on the `+` button on the top right of your Github page when you're logged in. Remember to tick off the `initialize with a readme` box. Think about whether you want them private or public.
{{< /alert >}}

But if you didn't tick the initialize box, you've embarked on the more complex way. In the screenshot below, I created a new repository but I forgot to initialize it, and now I'm looking at this page:

![non-initialized git](/images/github/github-complex.png)

If this is you, do not despair.

##### When you've forgotten to initialize a new repo:

You're going to have to install one or two things, and do some work at the **command prompt** or **terminal**.

1. If you have a PC, [click on this link to download and install git](https://git-scm.com/download/win). **Just use all of the suggested default settings when you run the installer**. If you have a Mac, you can install it by opening the terminal program (click on your applications and type 'terminal' in the search window) and then typing in these two commands (or copy and paste). The first command starts at the `/` and ends at the `"` and you must include the entire line from slash to closing quotation mark:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```
and when that finishes,

```
brew install git
```

2. Make a new directory on your computer **with the same name as the repo you created above**. For my screenshotted example above, that would be `week-two`.
3. On a PC, find the folder in your file explorer; click on it so that's the folder displayed in the address bar at the top of the explorer. Then, click in the address bar and type `cmd` and hit enter. This will open a command prompt window for that folder, allowing you to type commands in directly. On a Mac, go to System Preferences, select Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services. Look for 'New Terminal at Folder' and tick the box. Open your finder; find the folder you created, right-click and select 'open Terminal here'.

A Quick Primer for Working at the Command Line or Terminal

The following two videos, one for PC, one for Mac, show you how to do this. For reference's sake, this is what 'working at the command prompt' or 'working at the terminal' look like on your machine. When you interact with your computer, you can do it through a graphical interface - icons, clicks, etc - or you can directly type in commands. It's this latter kind of interaction that most people think of as 'coding', but for us, this is just 'opening the hood'.
{{< /alert >}}

PC:
{{<youtube yvpn1lITcVU >}}

Mac:
{{<youtube 0R25NOsAHh4 >}}

Key commands for PC:
+ `dir` show the contents of the current directory
+ `cls` clear the window so that it's fresh again
+ `cd directory-name` change director to the named directory
+ `cd ..` change directory up one level
+ if you hit the up or down arrows you can cycle through the history of commands you've already typed

Key commands for Mac:
+ `ls` list the contents of the current directory
+ `pwd` print the path (location) of the current directory
+ `cd directory-name` change director to the named directory
+ `cd ..` change directory up one level
+ `history` prints out the entire history of commands you've typed this session
+ up and down arrows will cycle through this list

---

4. Do you see where, in your browser at github, it says `...or create a new repository on the command line`? With your command prompt or terminal open in the appropriate folder on your machine (remember, folders on your machine = repos on github), type in each line exactly as it is there (beginning with `echo`), hitting enter at the end of each line, in order. **If the command works, you'll just be presented with the next prompt.** The computer only ever responds when there is output to print - which often means only when there is an error message to report. (**nb** Git might prompt you to enter your email and name, as it does in the PC video, the first time you ever do this).

Ta da! You can now go to `github.com\<your-user-name>\your-repo` and you'll see it all there tickety boo.

#### Making a new text file on Github

You can make a new text file by clicking on the 'create new file' button; **remember to always use .md as the file extension**. You can specify headers, links, images, bullets, blockquotes and so on by using [markdown conventions](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/.)

The two videos below might be a bit clearer on youtube itself.

{{<youtube 2SeeKYWXbrE >}}

#### Uploading a file into Github

You can add new files from your computer by dragging and dropping them into the main repository. At the end of this video, I show you how to display the image in the text of the reflection.

{{<youtube muKAh_j3Ogs >}}

#### Going further

Github can also be used to run an entire website, generated from your text files. In fact, that's how I built this course website! The following three links are from my HIST4806a 2020 seminar on digital history and museums; they will walk you through how to use your Github account to serve up a professional scholarly website; you can use this scholarly website to host your reflections and course work, if you want. Follow these three pages in order:

1. [Building Your Own Scholarly Website](https://shawngraham.github.io/dhmuse/building-your-online-presence/)

2. [Customizing Your Scholarly Website](https://shawngraham.github.io/dhmuse/customizing-your-site/)

3. [Updating Your Scholarly Website](https://shawngraham.github.io/dhmuse/updating-your-devlogs/)
