## Optional

This is an optional exercise.

## Format
The format of the exit ticket is up to you. Text, audio, video, multimedia: go wild.

## Content
Collect evidence detailing your journey in this course, and use the frame, 'So what is Cultural Heritage Informatics, anyway?' to situate your response. You might want to go back to the [course description](docs/1-coursedescription/) to see what you now think of that description.

This evidence might be individual annotations (yours or someone else's; remember, each annotation has its own permalink) that changed how you thought or make some argument you wish to engage with; it might be your own digital ephemera that emerges out of your contribution to our larger GLAM notebook infrastructure. You are expected of course to cite materials you've read to support your telling of the evolution of your learning. Indicate how this evidence and your trajectory speaks to the [learning outcomes](/docs/2-learning-outcomes) for this course. Please also reference any other evidence from your repositories, things you've read, things you've written that speak to your experience. Finally, you may wish to tie this discussion to what you have learned/observed about Ottawa GLAM scene.

**In essence, you're making the case to me now for what you understand  Cultural Heritage Informatics to be in the light of your own engagement.** Indicate what you think your letter grade ought reasonably to be, and why (go look at the learning outcomes again; don't just pull something out of the air).

This doesn't a long document|piece of media. But it has to be compelling and effective.

Put your Exit Ticket in a repo, along with whatever supporting material you need or a document with links (if the Exit Ticket lives in some other medium). You may make your repository private **or** public.

If you make it private, **make sure to 'invite user shawngraham'** to your repository so that I may view it.
